17576,Childish Gambino,This is on a bus back from camp
17577,Childish Gambino,I m thirteen and so are you
17578,Childish Gambino,Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
17579,Childish Gambino,I hadn t met yet running around all summer getting into trouble
17580,Childish Gambino,It turned out it would be me and just one girl That s you
17581,Childish Gambino,And we re still at camp as long as we re on the bus
17582,Childish Gambino,And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
17583,Childish Gambino,We re still wearing our orange camp t shirts We still smell like pineneedles
17584,Childish Gambino,I like you and you like me and I more than like you
17585,Childish Gambino,But I don t know if you do or don t more than like me
17586,Childish Gambino,You ve never said so I haven t been saying anything all summer
17587,Childish Gambino,Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
17588,Childish Gambino,And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
17589,Childish Gambino,A girl who s smart and funny and who if I say something dumb for a laugh
17590,Childish Gambino,Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
17591,Childish Gambino,But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
17592,Childish Gambino,A girl who reads books that no one s assigned to her
17593,Childish Gambino,Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
17594,Childish Gambino,From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
17595,Childish Gambino,Back in the real world we don t go to the same school
17596,Childish Gambino,And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
17597,Childish Gambino,We won t go to the same high school
17598,Childish Gambino,So this is kind of it for us Unless I say something
17599,Childish Gambino,And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
17600,Childish Gambino,The sun s gone down and the bus is quiet A lot of kids are asleep
17601,Childish Gambino,We re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
17602,Childish Gambino,That looks like a kid we know
17603,Childish Gambino,And then I m like  Can I tell you something  
17604,Childish Gambino,And all of a sudden I m telling you
17605,Childish Gambino,And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
17606,Childish Gambino,And your face is there and gone and there and gone
17607,Childish Gambino,As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
17608,Childish Gambino,And there s no expression on it
17609,Childish Gambino,And I think just after a point I m just talking to lengthen the time
17610,Childish Gambino,Where we live in a world where you haven t said  yes or  no yet
17611,Childish Gambino,And regrettably I end up using the word  destiny 
17612,Childish Gambino,I don t remember in what context Doesn t really matter
17613,Childish Gambino,Before long I m out of stuff to say and you smile and say  okay 
17614,Childish Gambino,I don t know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive
17615,Childish Gambino,And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
17616,Childish Gambino,But there s nowhere to go because we re on a bus
17617,Childish Gambino,So I pretend like I m asleep and before long I really am
17618,Childish Gambino,I wake up the bus isn t moving anymore
17619,Childish Gambino,The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
17620,Childish Gambino,I turn and you re not there
17621,Childish Gambino,Then again a lot of kids aren t in their seats anymore
17622,Childish Gambino,We re parked at the pick up point which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
17623,Childish Gambino,The bus is half empty You might be in your dad s car by now
17624,Childish Gambino,Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
17625,Childish Gambino,The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
17626,Childish Gambino,Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
17627,Childish Gambino,Just as one of them reaches my row
17628,Childish Gambino,It used to be our row on our way off
17629,Childish Gambino,It s Michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
17630,Childish Gambino,After throwing rocks at my head
17631,Childish Gambino,Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body wise
17632,Childish Gambino,She stops and looks down at me
17633,Childish Gambino,And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so I can t really see her face
17634,Childish Gambino,But I can see her smile And she says one word  destiny 
17635,Childish Gambino,Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
17636,Childish Gambino,And then she turns and leads them off the bus
17637,Childish Gambino,I didn t know you were friends with them
17638,Childish Gambino,I find my dad in the parking lot He drives me back to our house and camp is over
17639,Childish Gambino,So is summer even though there s two weeks until school starts
17640,Childish Gambino,This isn t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
17641,Childish Gambino,This is a story about how I learned something and I m not saying this thing is true or not
17642,Childish Gambino,I m just saying it s what I learned
17643,Childish Gambino,I told you something It was just for you and you told everybody
17644,Childish Gambino,So I learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always
17645,Childish Gambino,Everybody can t turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows I told them
17646,Childish Gambino,But this means there isn t a place in my life for you or someone like you
17647,Childish Gambino,Is it sad Sure But it s a sadness I chose
17648,Childish Gambino,I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
17649,Childish Gambino,And got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit
17650,Childish Gambino,But that s not true The truth is I got on the bus a boy And I never got off the bus

19792,Childish Gambino,A group of people are dancing around speakers Assumingly music is playing but the events of that scene are muted and replaced by the dialogue of   
19793,Childish Gambino,DONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses theyve written
19794,Childish Gambino,Investing time on writing lies slightly truth without a clue
19795,Childish Gambino,I met my higher self pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs

19831,Childish Gambino,DONALD examines his nose in the mirror surprised by the bleeding
19832,Childish Gambino,He looks for the source of all the blood and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage its a string
19833,Childish Gambino,Nauseated and scared he pulls the long blood soaked string while gagging and coughing Finally he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end a golden tooth
19834,Childish Gambino,He places it next to the sink and washes his hands as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower
19835,Childish Gambino,He is still and his back is to us
19836,Childish Gambino,DONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire eating smores and swapping childhood stories
19837,Childish Gambino,I remember being seventeen being scared as hell Getting prank calls like crazy stuff Just like senior year in high school Had a lot of girls its crazy So this one girl she was super crazy she would call my phone from a blocked number and it was her But then I started getting like the crazy death threats Started as a joke then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving where I liked to hang out Then they started shooting in the area so I couldnt sleep at home anymore Went and got a gun from my friend Started sleeping on the street for a week The scariest thing about it all though is having a gun knowing you might have to use it scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody Sometimes you cant explain why things happen Those seven days man just couldnt handle it Just couldnt handle it You just get to that point like why did I get here Sometimes they just do
19838,Childish Gambino,When I was like five or six we were living in Decatur in the projects On Commerce Drive Its nice now but like we were living there and I remember my moms friend Like a friend of the family This kid like   Something happened I didnt understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day I didnt really understand it But we didnt have any space So he had to sleep in my bed I remember in the morning waking up and he was like  Lets rub butts  I was like  okay like whatever I did it And I didnt really get it And then I turned when we turned he kissed me

19846,Childish Gambino,He is flying face up eyes closed The phone rings and he opens his eyes
19847,Childish Gambino,He leans over and picks up the phone
