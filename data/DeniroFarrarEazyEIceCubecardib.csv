47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police

47894,Ice Cube,Hit the  dollar stick and I put in my clip
47895,Ice Cube,So I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
47896,Ice Cube,I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross
47897,Ice Cube,Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
47898,Ice Cube,Thinkin should I peel his cap or should I let him survive
47899,Ice Cube,Yo Im trapped in the plan designed by another side
47900,Ice Cube,I aint contributin to genocide  why  
47901,Ice Cube,Niggas in the hood aint changed
47902,Ice Cube,And Ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang
47903,Ice Cube,Cuz I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
47904,Ice Cube,Every which way I get burned 
47905,Ice Cube,Baby Lou wears blue Big Fred wears red
47906,Ice Cube,Put em together and we color em dead

47909,Ice Cube,I understand how all my homeboys feel
47910,Ice Cube,Cuz I been shot to this day I pack my steel
47911,Ice Cube,Cuz I was born in a certain territory
47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep
47915,Ice Cube,Cuz me and T bone we pay it no mind
47916,Ice Cube,And for the rest of the mob we stay color blind

47924,Ice Cube,I got the A to the motherfuckin K and its ready to rip
47925,Ice Cube,Is he in Watts Oakland Philly or Brooklyn 
47926,Ice Cube,It seems like he got the whole country behind him
47927,Ice Cube,So its sort of hard to find him
47928,Ice Cube,But when I do gotta put my gat in his mouth
47929,Ice Cube,Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
47930,Ice Cube,Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
47931,Ice Cube,Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore
47932,Ice Cube,So now Im settin up the ultimate drive by
47933,Ice Cube,And when you hear this shit

47941,Ice Cube,He came to my house I let em bail in
47942,Ice Cube,Cause he said he was down with the LM
47943,Ice Cube,Then turned around and pulled out a gat
47944,Ice Cube,I said  Please dont kill my mother  so he raped her
47945,Ice Cube,Tied me up took me outside
47946,Ice Cube,And I was thrown in a big truck
