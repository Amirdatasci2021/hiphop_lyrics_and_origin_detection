70462,Kendrick Lamar,I know exactly what happened
70463,Kendrick Lamar,You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
70464,Kendrick Lamar,Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
70465,Kendrick Lamar,Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up

70491,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70492,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70493,Kendrick Lamar,You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
70494,Kendrick Lamar,The message resembled  Brendas Got a Baby 
70495,Kendrick Lamar,Whats crazy was I was hearin about it

70509,Kendrick Lamar,See my hormones just run away and if I can get em
70510,Kendrick Lamar,Back to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
70511,Kendrick Lamar,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
70512,Kendrick Lamar,Or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
70513,Kendrick Lamar,Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught
70514,Kendrick Lamar,Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed
70515,Kendrick Lamar,And Im exhausted but fuck that  Sorry for your loss shit
70516,Kendrick Lamar,My sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain
70517,Kendrick Lamar,If you cant fit the pumps I walk in 
70518,Kendrick Lamar,Ill wait Your rebuttal a little too late
70519,Kendrick Lamar,And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song
70520,Kendrick Lamar,Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
70521,Kendrick Lamar,And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great 
70522,Kendrick Lamar,A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
70523,Kendrick Lamar,Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
70524,Kendrick Lamar,Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
70525,Kendrick Lamar,And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get it or die tryin
70526,Kendrick Lamar,Im eyein every male gender with intentions of buyin

70534,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me

70537,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70538,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70539,Kendrick Lamar,Sometimes I look in the mirror
70540,Kendrick Lamar,And ask myself Am I really scared of passin away 
70541,Kendrick Lamar,If its today I hope I hear a
70542,Kendrick Lamar,Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
70543,Kendrick Lamar,With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
70544,Kendrick Lamar,I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
70545,Kendrick Lamar,The scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
70546,Kendrick Lamar,With the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
70547,Kendrick Lamar,May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
70548,Kendrick Lamar,And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
70549,Kendrick Lamar,And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
70550,Kendrick Lamar,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
70551,Kendrick Lamar,That can come about  cause the tongue is mighty powerful
70552,Kendrick Lamar,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
70553,Kendrick Lamar,Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
70554,Kendrick Lamar,Really stuck in the schema of wonderin when Ima rest
70555,Kendrick Lamar,And youre right your brother was a brother to me
70556,Kendrick Lamar,And your sisters situation was the one that pulled me

71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
