47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts

47899,Ice Cube,Yo Im trapped in the plan designed by another side
47900,Ice Cube,I aint contributin to genocide  why  
47901,Ice Cube,Niggas in the hood aint changed
47902,Ice Cube,And Ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang
47903,Ice Cube,Cuz I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
47904,Ice Cube,Every which way I get burned

47910,Ice Cube,Cuz I been shot to this day I pack my steel
47911,Ice Cube,Cuz I was born in a certain territory
47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep

47928,Ice Cube,But when I do gotta put my gat in his mouth
47929,Ice Cube,Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
47930,Ice Cube,Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
