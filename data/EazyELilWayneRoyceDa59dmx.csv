105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
