82090,Lupe Fiasco,Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
82091,Lupe Fiasco,Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
82092,Lupe Fiasco,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself
82105,Lupe Fiasco,As most important source of help
82106,Lupe Fiasco,And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
82107,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82108,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
82109,Lupe Fiasco,On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
82110,Lupe Fiasco,It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
82111,Lupe Fiasco,They understand the Internet better than their parents
82112,Lupe Fiasco,Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
82113,Lupe Fiasco,Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
82114,Lupe Fiasco,A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
82115,Lupe Fiasco,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
82116,Lupe Fiasco, Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
82117,Lupe Fiasco,Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches  
82118,Lupe Fiasco,Now lets say that they less concerned with him
82119,Lupe Fiasco,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
82120,Lupe Fiasco,Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
82121,Lupe Fiasco,Reality check Im not trippin
82122,Lupe Fiasco,They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
82123,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82124,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82125,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82126,Lupe Fiasco,Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using  bitch as a lesson
82127,Lupe Fiasco,But as a psychological weapon
82128,Lupe Fiasco,To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
82129,Lupe Fiasco,Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
82130,Lupe Fiasco, Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
82131,Lupe Fiasco,Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
82132,Lupe Fiasco,Sho enough in this little world
82133,Lupe Fiasco,The little boy meets one of those little girls
82134,Lupe Fiasco,And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
82135,Lupe Fiasco,He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
82136,Lupe Fiasco,She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
82137,Lupe Fiasco,He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
82138,Lupe Fiasco,Momma never dressed like that
82139,Lupe Fiasco,Come out the house hot mess like that
82140,Lupe Fiasco,Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
82141,Lupe Fiasco,Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
82142,Lupe Fiasco,He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
82143,Lupe Fiasco, Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
82144,Lupe Fiasco,But  bad mean bad to him  bitch dont play a part
82145,Lupe Fiasco,But  bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
82146,Lupe Fiasco,But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre 
82147,Lupe Fiasco,Tell em bitch bad woman good
82148,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82149,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82150,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82151,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82152,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better greatest motherhood
82153,Lupe Fiasco,Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
82154,Lupe Fiasco,Vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
82155,Lupe Fiasco,To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
82156,Lupe Fiasco,Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
82157,Lupe Fiasco,Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm 
82158,Lupe Fiasco,But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
82159,Lupe Fiasco,So what powers cowards to get them to the top

84441,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84442,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84443,Lupe Fiasco,In the same suit that he was buried in
84444,Lupe Fiasco,Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
84445,Lupe Fiasco,Yes he was still fresh to death
84446,Lupe Fiasco,Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
84447,Lupe Fiasco,He still had it cause they couldnt find it
84448,Lupe Fiasco,And the bullets from his enemies
84449,Lupe Fiasco,Sat like two inches behind it
84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
84457,Lupe Fiasco,Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher

84463,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84482,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84483,Lupe Fiasco,Caught the reflection in the window
84484,Lupe Fiasco,Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
84485,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah and gettin back in his lane
84486,Lupe Fiasco,First he had to find something to slang
84487,Lupe Fiasco,Walked right past the same spot
84488,Lupe Fiasco,That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
84489,Lupe Fiasco,It just felt weird being on the opposite
84490,Lupe Fiasco,They figured that he wasnt from there
