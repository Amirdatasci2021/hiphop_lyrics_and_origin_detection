104947,Royce Da 59,Number one but my pencils are number twos
104948,Royce Da 59,Cause thats all I dos with em poop is my pseudonym
104949,Royce Da 59,On the john like a prostitute when Im droppin a deuce
104950,Royce Da 59,And when Im producing them lyrical bowel movements
104951,Royce Da 59,These beats are like my saloons
104952,Royce Da 59,Cause these bars always got my stools in em
104953,Royce Da 59,And I dont need Metamucil to loosen em
104954,Royce Da 59,Bitch shit is real like I pooped Jerusalem
104955,Royce Da 59,Im bout to go spin another cocoon
104956,Royce Da 59,Then Im cuttin you from your mothers womb
104957,Royce Da 59, Cruising down the river dancing till your feet got numb cool summer breezes blowing through your hair as you stood gazing down the river in anticipation of the thrill of the dizzying rides at the amusement park ah memories of Bob Lo Island  
104958,Royce Da 59,All is your world ain t nothing but a squirrel tryna get a nut Just jealous of everybody that s headed out on that Bob Lo boat It is the perfect weather and the perfect time to enjoy a few snacks Aw man I wish I was joining you a little cheese and crackers a little Cana wine a little Riunite on ice some Harvey s Bristol Cream but let s do this only on Smooth FM 
104959,Royce Da 59,Nothing compared to our family trips
104960,Royce Da 59,My uncle shook hands with a manly grip
104961,Royce Da 59,All this hand me down shit I had had an uncanny fit
104962,Royce Da 59,All the gangstas I had in my family had me anti bitch
104963,Royce Da 59,My granddaddy mistress caught the business from my granny fist
104964,Royce Da 59,That was back  fore I was born
104965,Royce Da 59,Pop told stories  bout it that would last for hours long
104966,Royce Da 59,And as a family we was just so happy
104967,Royce Da 59,When him and mama got along on the Bob Lo boat
104968,Royce Da 59,Uh on our way to that black amusement park
104969,Royce Da 59,Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
104970,Royce Da 59,Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court
104971,Royce Da 59,Broken glass waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
104972,Royce Da 59,I came across my identity on the Bob Lo boat
104973,Royce Da 59,That s where I lost my virginity no condom though
104974,Royce Da 59,That s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
104975,Royce Da 59,Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
104976,Royce Da 59,Parties on the way to the island would be the livest though
104977,Royce Da 59,First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Bob Lo boat
104978,Royce Da 59,But neither one of us knew that we would both
104979,Royce Da 59,Grow up and turn to alcoholics though the Bob Lo boat
104980,Royce Da 59,Hey hey hey lil Craig come here Aye hit this nigga Nigga don t worry  bout what the fuck it is just drink 
104981,Royce Da 59,Some of my better times I shared with you
104982,Royce Da 59,Shit all of my better days I shared with you
104983,Royce Da 59,And now I gotta wake up wake up wake up wake up wake up

104985,Royce Da 59,Wake up wake up wake up wake up again
104986,Royce Da 59,Stuck inside this rat race  fuck 
104987,Royce Da 59,Twist the cap lift the bottle back swig it
104988,Royce Da 59,Dig it ten inch rims on my mama s Civic
104989,Royce Da 59,Ten inch woofers in the trunk to be specific
104990,Royce Da 59,They bump rattle the license plate plus the windows tinted
104991,Royce Da 59,Don t even give a fuck that it s dented bitch I m the man now
104992,Royce Da 59,I m rolling driving it slow as if it s stolen
104993,Royce Da 59,Piling up bros like we was clothing on a dresser
104994,Royce Da 59,Calling up hoes like we was Jodeci let s check her
104995,Royce Da 59,Double D s like double deckers I wanna sex her
104996,Royce Da 59,But these keys don t come with game on how to finesse her
104997,Royce Da 59,Five semesters left until college I m under pressure
104998,Royce Da 59,I m not a real nigga  til I undress her I gotta  press her
104999,Royce Da 59,This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
105000,Royce Da 59,Nowadays I often yearn to press the
105001,Royce Da 59,Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
105002,Royce Da 59,Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
105003,Royce Da 59,My real life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of
105004,Royce Da 59,Jermaine Lamarr but that s insane it couldn t be further left of
105005,Royce Da 59,The truth is that my new shit slap you never heard it better
105006,Royce Da 59,Give me a sec I murder sectors prefer to let ya
105007,Royce Da 59,See it rather than say it but it spill out I gotta chill out
105008,Royce Da 59,Say  Fuck the world and never pull out
105009,Royce Da 59,We had no Bob Lo boat but I could note
105010,Royce Da 59,Those times is like a Bible quote
105011,Royce Da 59,BC before cell phones the first time I would smoke
105012,Royce Da 59,I was six years old but that s for another chapter
105013,Royce Da 59,That s for another story to God be the glory
105014,Royce Da 59,I made it out unscathed and now I sunbathe
105015,Royce Da 59,With my son in Tanzanian sunrays thinking  bout them days
105016,Royce Da 59,Nigga dont worry about what the fuck it is just drink
