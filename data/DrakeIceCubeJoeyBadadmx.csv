47474,Ice Cube,How to survive in South Central  what you do  
47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive

47500,Ice Cube,Pissed off black human beings
47501,Ice Cube,So I think you better skip the sight seeing
47502,Ice Cube,And if youre nuttin but a mark
47503,Ice Cube,Make sure that youre in before dark
47504,Ice Cube,But if you need some affection mate

47523,Ice Cube,To an undercover or the wrong brother
47524,Ice Cube,And theyll smother a out of town motherfucker
