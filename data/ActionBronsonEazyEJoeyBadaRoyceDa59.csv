105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic

105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice

105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see

105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show

105407,Royce Da 59,Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out

105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
105428,Royce Da 59,It showed me that God is real God is real
