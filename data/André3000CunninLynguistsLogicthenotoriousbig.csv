23514,CunninLynguists,Love aint for the faint of heart
23515,CunninLynguists,Start training this game is hard
23516,CunninLynguists,And arduous youre gonna play in the dark like when it rains in the park
23517,CunninLynguists,Youre hardly conscious of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic
23518,CunninLynguists,To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
23519,CunninLynguists,Now youre working yourself out the same as when you strain with a nautilus
23520,CunninLynguists,And youre willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
23521,CunninLynguists,If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
23522,CunninLynguists,Then do you really regret when youve shredded your promises 
23523,CunninLynguists,Now Ive tested the waters kid Sipped it rippled the pond a bit
23524,CunninLynguists,Visits have been abolished and this shits killing my confidence
23525,CunninLynguists,Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment 
23526,CunninLynguists,If you miss chicks when theyre around the phrase  Lets quit isnt an option
23527,CunninLynguists,You best fix whatevers wrong and just move on and get on with it
23528,CunninLynguists,Cause Youll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
23529,CunninLynguists,Its sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch
23530,CunninLynguists,When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
23531,CunninLynguists,Cause It isnt really my time is it Shit I just found the watch
23532,CunninLynguists,But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock
23533,CunninLynguists,And I cant die without trying my hands tied in knots
23534,CunninLynguists,Knowing that Ill never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
23535,CunninLynguists,Love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of
23536,CunninLynguists,Death  its as massive a shock
23537,CunninLynguists,And to intellects its a fuckin smack in the crotch
23538,CunninLynguists,Its a cancer that rots your soul tosses demons off of the road
23539,CunninLynguists,Just use caution and know that love aint nothing but a loss of control
23540,CunninLynguists,Lovell have you nervous doing stupid shit on purpose
23541,CunninLynguists,Brain out of service words slurred when you blurt shit
23542,CunninLynguists,Studderin utterin non sensical shit in your verses
23543,CunninLynguists,Feeling like a shirtless four breasted woman in a circus
23544,CunninLynguists,Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
23545,CunninLynguists,Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
23546,CunninLynguists,So girls create a false world of filling on boys
23547,CunninLynguists,Exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
23548,CunninLynguists,But when you have it theres nothing like it you get excited
23549,CunninLynguists,Seeking those who provide it on phones talking to psychics
23550,CunninLynguists,Some fear it spend their entire lives trying to fight it
23551,CunninLynguists,Living in a confusing Hayes like theyre grooving to Isaac
23552,CunninLynguists,It aint the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
23553,CunninLynguists,It aint easily learnable with definitions in tact
23554,CunninLynguists,It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
23555,CunninLynguists,Hittin and bullwhippin you leavin them slits in your back
23556,CunninLynguists,But Ive been a lucky one loving parents loving friends
23557,CunninLynguists,But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
23558,CunninLynguists,But I aint a genius on it I can only pretend
23559,CunninLynguists,Cause over all its an emotion I cannot comprehend
23560,CunninLynguists,Love aint the basis for action
23561,CunninLynguists,In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
23562,CunninLynguists,Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
23563,CunninLynguists,Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
23564,CunninLynguists,And the past isnt felt as a match made in hell
23565,CunninLynguists,But rather its held as a latter day meld
23566,CunninLynguists,Of common mistakes and nice intentions
23567,CunninLynguists,But when false love retention is simply vice invention
23568,CunninLynguists,Its only right to mention the fights you get in
23569,CunninLynguists,Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
23570,CunninLynguists,So whats love really got to do with it 
23571,CunninLynguists,From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
23572,CunninLynguists,The truth isnt as eloquent so be intelligent
23573,CunninLynguists,Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of its irrelevant
23574,CunninLynguists,And that wordll fit like a glove if you dont get right
23575,CunninLynguists,Now live your life for the love or stop
23576,CunninLynguists, So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin 
23577,CunninLynguists, Yeah Why dont you rap for food then  
23578,CunninLynguists,Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef

24008,CunninLynguists,Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
24009,CunninLynguists,Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
24010,CunninLynguists,A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
24011,CunninLynguists,Life is like a lion and Im dying at its feet
24012,CunninLynguists,I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
24013,CunninLynguists,Ive seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B roll
24014,CunninLynguists,My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
24015,CunninLynguists,And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
24016,CunninLynguists,My memory banks the only thing I tend to rob

24099,CunninLynguists,Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel s titties
24100,CunninLynguists,Then as soon as I started getting some pride
24101,CunninLynguists,My sister hydroplaned and died on I   
24102,CunninLynguists,In a family full of pride house full of tears
24103,CunninLynguists,Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
24104,CunninLynguists,Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
24105,CunninLynguists,Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
24106,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24107,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24108,CunninLynguists,I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
24109,CunninLynguists,And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
24110,CunninLynguists,Cant grow fond of past memories
24111,CunninLynguists,Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
24112,CunninLynguists,Offended by the mental imagery
24113,CunninLynguists,And suggest livin in poverty was really meant for me
24114,CunninLynguists,Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
24115,CunninLynguists,Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
24116,CunninLynguists,I cant begin to see how to control the flash backs
24117,CunninLynguists,Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
24118,CunninLynguists,Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
24119,CunninLynguists,When I dont perceive what I feel I deserve
24120,CunninLynguists,Being slurred by those not livin in my position
24121,CunninLynguists,My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
24122,CunninLynguists,And when I thought Id risen life freezes the frame
24123,CunninLynguists,So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain
24124,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24125,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24126,CunninLynguists,I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
24127,CunninLynguists,Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
24128,CunninLynguists,You know what blasphemys like cursing at God
24129,CunninLynguists,Cause you aint got shit it hurts and its hard
24130,CunninLynguists,Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
24131,CunninLynguists,Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
24132,CunninLynguists,Most of my lifes a daze got me forever lighting haze
24133,CunninLynguists,Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
24134,CunninLynguists,For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
24135,CunninLynguists,Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
24136,CunninLynguists,Few friends even then most homies is fake
24137,CunninLynguists,Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
24138,CunninLynguists,I went from the block with my fam to college exams
24139,CunninLynguists,But the pressures still there dog Im still scared
24140,CunninLynguists,But I know it will all be right in the end
24141,CunninLynguists,As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen
24142,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24143,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24144,CunninLynguists,Its four o clock on a Sunday morning
24145,CunninLynguists,Who the hell is calling my phone 
24146,CunninLynguists,Waking me up Im stretching and yawning
24147,CunninLynguists,If you had any sense youd leave me alone
24148,CunninLynguists,Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
24149,CunninLynguists,I m in jail I need bail Again the word is bond
24150,CunninLynguists,Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
24151,CunninLynguists,With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
24152,CunninLynguists,Can you free me  fore my prints get back 
24153,CunninLynguists,And they run em through the system and realize that Im black
24154,CunninLynguists,All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack
24155,CunninLynguists,Said her name was December than she sat on my lap
24156,CunninLynguists,Liquor and higher power my witness
24157,CunninLynguists,I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness
24158,CunninLynguists,With all these nice drinks compliments of Dennis
24159,CunninLynguists,Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths
24160,CunninLynguists,Whoever the fuck Dennis is Dennis is pissed 
24161,CunninLynguists,Cus I don t think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all fam

24166,CunninLynguists,Mainly cuz I now consider you one
24167,CunninLynguists,I wanna let you go but every time I seem to screw up
24168,CunninLynguists,Now that s the problem with the space that you occupy
24169,CunninLynguists,It s going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind
24170,CunninLynguists,A box of wine and a carton of coffin nails will
24171,CunninLynguists,Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin 
24172,CunninLynguists,Like  Hey bitch How the hell have you been

24209,CunninLynguists,But today my pimp look more like Polio
24210,CunninLynguists,Overdosed off of beauty got me comatose
24211,CunninLynguists,Shorty so blessed makes the Reverend catch a holy ghost
24212,CunninLynguists,They just sparkle and they twinkle and I m hypnotized
24213,CunninLynguists,Her stare cut through and I m hypnotized  
24214,CunninLynguists,The way her booty sway got me caught up in a daze

24248,CunninLynguists,Diluted her genes it stopped the music it seemed
24249,CunninLynguists,That theyd only seen polluted stream and that wasnt clean
24250,CunninLynguists,Said he could almost no longer stand the breath
24251,CunninLynguists,From this pure horror more worse than Amittyville
24252,CunninLynguists,So whats next Dont answer me yield  yup 
24253,CunninLynguists,This is a normal occurrence not something randomly real
24254,CunninLynguists,Aint even allowed visits over a childs pigment

24256,CunninLynguists,Hard times baby daddy grinds to support
24257,CunninLynguists,His mother and a few other friends privately in her fort
24258,CunninLynguists,For short stays ya know but more aid was needed
24259,CunninLynguists,Baby is like a year and a half now and speaking
24260,CunninLynguists,More than I can say about that man with his child
24261,CunninLynguists,They cant even come face to face and share smiles
24262,CunninLynguists,Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
24263,CunninLynguists,Like she spawned a fucking anti Christ or a Satan infant
24264,CunninLynguists,Blatant mentions about family blood wont leave
24265,CunninLynguists,Loves her deeply but evil sends its opposite feed
24266,CunninLynguists,Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
24267,CunninLynguists,If he could just set it aside thered be heaven to pay
24268,CunninLynguists,Then weathered and aged time swept him to grave
24269,CunninLynguists,Love conquers all shit Id say that areas grey
24270,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why   X 
24271,CunninLynguists,Most dont even know why they believe what they believe man
24272,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24273,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg
24274,CunninLynguists,In the dark walls blocking all that light
24275,CunninLynguists,Most dont even know why they believe what they believe man
24276,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24277,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg
24278,CunninLynguists,Looking at life in retrospect its hard to regret
24279,CunninLynguists,Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
24280,CunninLynguists,Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
24281,CunninLynguists,Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
24282,CunninLynguists,And even though nobodys life is ever perfect
24283,CunninLynguists,You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
24284,CunninLynguists,Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
24285,CunninLynguists,Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
24286,CunninLynguists,People who pimp children are really raping religion
24287,CunninLynguists,The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
24288,CunninLynguists,But now the technology follows me solemnly
24289,CunninLynguists,Building the future laws to my philosophy
24290,CunninLynguists,Alzheimers cutting through like a lobotomy
24291,CunninLynguists,Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
24292,CunninLynguists,Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
24293,CunninLynguists,I survived disease and political crisis
24294,CunninLynguists,By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
24295,CunninLynguists,And now I live vicariously through my kids
24296,CunninLynguists,Like people who love the sport but cant play for shit
24297,CunninLynguists,Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
24298,CunninLynguists,I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
24299,CunninLynguists,Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
24300,CunninLynguists,But just before I vanish as I think Im at the end
24301,CunninLynguists,The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
24302,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24303,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24304,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24305,CunninLynguists,The world is changing day to day
24306,CunninLynguists,It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
24307,CunninLynguists,Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
24308,CunninLynguists,Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
24309,CunninLynguists,I feel weathered but feel like Ive been driving forever
24310,CunninLynguists,Showin up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
24311,CunninLynguists,Ive been better but all things pass
24312,CunninLynguists,This life is taking everything away but youre provided with your past
24313,CunninLynguists,So fuck it  I stick to having dreams on the road
24314,CunninLynguists,But until this dream is done Im gonna keep my eyes closed
24315,CunninLynguists,And breathe breathe when it snows
24316,CunninLynguists,Breathe when Im forced to live a life with a person on a phone
24317,CunninLynguists,Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin
24318,CunninLynguists,Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
24319,CunninLynguists,Cause after the show when the last star shines
24320,CunninLynguists,I can make this all better when I close my eyes
24321,CunninLynguists,Im in another zone where troubles gone
24322,CunninLynguists,Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
24323,CunninLynguists,A place where life is easy for everybody else
24324,CunninLynguists,I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
24325,CunninLynguists,But we dont know it where we dont show it all
24326,CunninLynguists,For life aint protocol under sky over law
24327,CunninLynguists,Im in another space where all the food is good
24328,CunninLynguists,And theres enough for everybody in my neighborhood
24329,CunninLynguists,Where all the grass is blue where we dont know bout green
24330,CunninLynguists,Cause money aint a thing I pinch myself its not a dream
24331,CunninLynguists,Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
24332,CunninLynguists,If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldnt mean a thing
24333,CunninLynguists,Between climbing and finding it not worth it
24334,CunninLynguists,Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
24335,CunninLynguists,Im so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
24336,CunninLynguists,I think of home when I close my eyes
24337,CunninLynguists,So done with the smokes and fries
24338,CunninLynguists,Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
24339,CunninLynguists,Drinks I shouldnt drink things I never write
24340,CunninLynguists,Cities I never liked now its like aight
24341,CunninLynguists,Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
24342,CunninLynguists,Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
24343,CunninLynguists,My work is love no complaints Im fine
24344,CunninLynguists,Its been a long night cant wait to close my eyes
24345,CunninLynguists,I dream of an industry ego less
24346,CunninLynguists,And free from the modern chains with these chains were so deep in love
24347,CunninLynguists,Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
24348,CunninLynguists,Dreaming a publicist wasnt  Gs a month
24349,CunninLynguists,And where its not about numbers and math
24350,CunninLynguists,And I was content with really just a couple of fans
24351,CunninLynguists,And my happiness wasnt relying on tours and a van
24352,CunninLynguists,Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
24353,CunninLynguists,With the front front row stadium packed
24354,CunninLynguists,And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
24355,CunninLynguists,And scream at them  Look at me now look at me man 
24356,CunninLynguists,Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
24357,CunninLynguists,Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
24358,CunninLynguists,Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
24359,CunninLynguists,I woke up and realized it was a dream
24360,CunninLynguists,Wide awake in the rap game but life Im asleep
24361,CunninLynguists,You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
24362,CunninLynguists,I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
24363,CunninLynguists,Part of my shine comes from the distance
24364,CunninLynguists,You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
24365,CunninLynguists,Is this business emotionally invested 
24366,CunninLynguists,Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
24367,CunninLynguists,Love is war sex is a weapon
24368,CunninLynguists,The mind is a mine so watch where youre steppin
24369,CunninLynguists,Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
24370,CunninLynguists,Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
24371,CunninLynguists,Feelings are just filling in this half baked scene
24372,CunninLynguists,To make x rated into nc   
24373,CunninLynguists,Then see everything she got she not shy
24374,CunninLynguists,Our love below so dro we most high
24375,CunninLynguists,Then wears off when what we wears on
24376,CunninLynguists,Again I turn away when what we shares gone
24377,CunninLynguists,If this is not the hardest part
24378,CunninLynguists,If passion dies within routine
24379,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared
24380,CunninLynguists,Could have been fearless and unprepared
24381,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared
24382,CunninLynguists,Could have been fearless and unprepared
24383,CunninLynguists,Under the twilight and we living the Miller Highlife
24384,CunninLynguists,La Petite Mort my lady we bout to die twice
24385,CunninLynguists,I wont surrender and you wont surrender yurn
24386,CunninLynguists,Whatever happens after this moments of no concern
24387,CunninLynguists,But its hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
24388,CunninLynguists,Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
24389,CunninLynguists,We wired for desire dangers to ourselves
24390,CunninLynguists,Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
24391,CunninLynguists,My muse sleeps deep within time
24392,CunninLynguists,I go to her for credit though I need to decline
24393,CunninLynguists,Its easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
24394,CunninLynguists,Im sorry its just the way we designed
24395,CunninLynguists,My dear we should leave here Im talking bout one at a time though
24396,CunninLynguists,Cause you got me changin my mind slow
24397,CunninLynguists,Leave here says that voice in the back of my spine
24398,CunninLynguists,As I awake and the moment rewinds
24399,CunninLynguists,Even when we reach the top
24400,CunninLynguists,Im tryna reach the top of my dreams
24401,CunninLynguists,Thats why Im mapping out the script
24402,CunninLynguists,And slowly plottin my scenes
24403,CunninLynguists,They never get the picture
24404,CunninLynguists,Even when theyre watchin that screen
24405,CunninLynguists,Thats why they underestimate me cause Im not what I seem
24406,CunninLynguists,Im quite different  entirely focused on making wise decisions
24407,CunninLynguists,Id rather risk a huge mistake than spend my life wishin
24408,CunninLynguists,I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
24409,CunninLynguists,Cause when youre gone its just that coffin that you lie stiff in
24410,CunninLynguists,Six feet under makes me wonder

24907,CunninLynguists,Thinking  Damn My whole life I was just a dreamer
24908,CunninLynguists,I never got to put on a show in a packed arena
24909,CunninLynguists,I wanted to go on Rap City and act witty

24911,CunninLynguists,That didnt get me there in time and now were losing our globe 
24912,CunninLynguists,What could fuck up a planet in one day without warning 
24913,CunninLynguists,And even if the world does end I cant be mad at God
24914,CunninLynguists,Cause life coulda been much worse At least Im satisfied
24915,CunninLynguists,At least my dads alive married to my mother
24916,CunninLynguists,I have a sister and friends that I could call my brothers
24917,CunninLynguists,At least I have life Some people their life was stolen
24918,CunninLynguists,Set up for a crime and behind bars is where they hold em
24919,CunninLynguists,We got kids killing kids cause Earth is cold
24920,CunninLynguists,Women using abortions as a form of birth control
24921,CunninLynguists,It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience
24922,CunninLynguists,But its a blessing that I made it through this nonsense
24923,CunninLynguists,So even if this will be my last night
24924,CunninLynguists,At least when its over Ill be doin alright   
24925,CunninLynguists,Back in the   th century way way back in the day
24926,CunninLynguists,Nostradamous predicted the world would be on may
24927,CunninLynguists, th    three years later and change
24928,CunninLynguists,The World Trades frame got struck by planes
24929,CunninLynguists,Looking like God unleashed his fury and rained flames
24930,CunninLynguists,Exchanged pain for how America came to fame
24931,CunninLynguists,Cluthing my brain my sense of security changed
24932,CunninLynguists,Usually confidence was pure in me now fear in my veins
24933,CunninLynguists,Said  any of this shit could brang nuclear weapons
24934,CunninLynguists,   any of this shit could end at any second 
24935,CunninLynguists,If the Commander in Chief couldnt insure our protection
24936,CunninLynguists,Thats no more additions to my memorys collection
24937,CunninLynguists,Missing me and my girls matrimonial connection
24938,CunninLynguists,No child and videotapin her first steppings
24939,CunninLynguists,Or growing old and teaching grandchildren lifes lessons
24940,CunninLynguists,But thankfully I got saved during them church sessions
24941,CunninLynguists,So I thank God for earths blessings   health
24942,CunninLynguists,Not alot of wealth but alot of peace within my self
24943,CunninLynguists,Not a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf
24944,CunninLynguists,Disclipline from loving parents though they raised me
24945,CunninLynguists,When I was young I was wild
24946,CunninLynguists, christ hope he could stand it
24947,CunninLynguists,Now I do right  wherever I can manage
24948,CunninLynguists,The devil was eating me alive but I climbed out of that sandwich
24949,CunninLynguists,Now possibly on the verge of having everything vanish
24950,CunninLynguists,Feeling as if I didnt do anything as I planned it
24951,CunninLynguists,Like I was trying to live my life right but somebody panned it
24952,CunninLynguists,But I still had love when down helping hands lifted
24953,CunninLynguists,Me up outta the mud outta the muck
24954,CunninLynguists,And outta the dark and attitude when I didnt give a fuck
24955,CunninLynguists,From them days in the park alone drinking gin by the cup
24956,CunninLynguists,Through an exitless maze wandering and constantly stuck
24957,CunninLynguists,The blessings were always there I just chose to ignore them
24958,CunninLynguists,Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
24959,CunninLynguists,Wasnt selfish with them trying to stretch and contort them
24960,CunninLynguists,And didnt let the world get to them first and distort them
24961,CunninLynguists,So as I  kick back and ponder on armeggedon
24962,CunninLynguists,And I   spit raps about where my life couldve been headin
24963,CunninLynguists,I  admit that  I do have a wonderful life
24964,CunninLynguists,So if this night was my last ill be doin alright
24965,CunninLynguists,Searching for answers is like searching for Atlantis
24966,CunninLynguists,Im working poor and Im just hurting for some chances
24967,CunninLynguists,This school of a livings like prison on a campus
24968,CunninLynguists,Show me the Monet and the pixels in that canvas
24969,CunninLynguists,Advance through my imagery I view my evil deeds
24970,CunninLynguists,When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory
24971,CunninLynguists,When I called on Mary J be my serenity
24972,CunninLynguists,So I dont see that all my enemies resembled me
24973,CunninLynguists,Im feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
24974,CunninLynguists,Im trying to place but my heart aint even in the race
24975,CunninLynguists,Ive came far enough that turning back is time wasted
24976,CunninLynguists,Imprisoned by fear I dont need no iron bracelets
24977,CunninLynguists,Whats my fate how can I escape my heart
24978,CunninLynguists,Running blind an open mind could break this dark
24979,CunninLynguists,A major spark might just make a star in this    
24980,CunninLynguists,Way under in slumber is my true self shown
24981,CunninLynguists,A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown
24982,CunninLynguists,Pane in the windows of a once happy home
24983,CunninLynguists,I m a Cheshire Cat laughin at the caged birds song
24984,CunninLynguists,A caterpillar shroomin usin fumes from my bong
24985,CunninLynguists,To cloud a land wondering what fuels what is wrong
24986,CunninLynguists,Lust in my loins vengeance in my heart
24987,CunninLynguists,Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
24988,CunninLynguists,Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
24989,CunninLynguists,I can t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
24990,CunninLynguists,That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
24991,CunninLynguists,Opinions of my health my self and wealth go off the chart
24992,CunninLynguists,My struggle to keep balance ain t a challenge it s an art
24993,CunninLynguists,Outside my sleep is silent  cause inside the war is fought
24994,CunninLynguists,Every night as I fade to the

25663,CunninLynguists,Apocalypse approaches in the form of divide
25664,CunninLynguists,Too many bees in the trap bear hands in the hive

25676,CunninLynguists,Streets are dead from the killings
25677,CunninLynguists,Im like damn blocks hot not from the ozone
25678,CunninLynguists,Through cameras cops watch these lil boys hold chrome

25710,CunninLynguists,I am floating happy not knowing nautical course
25711,CunninLynguists,Tie a wristwatch in slipknots and dock at my porch
25712,CunninLynguists,Time is of no essence the presence becomes presents
25713,CunninLynguists,Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance
25714,CunninLynguists,Current currencies worthless fodder for feeding purses
25715,CunninLynguists,With iron clad words I solder together verses
25716,CunninLynguists,I m trippin like I m eatin the fungi
25717,CunninLynguists,Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye
25718,CunninLynguists,Theres no light just never ending night
25719,CunninLynguists,And the weathers like a hurricane when land is in its sight
25720,CunninLynguists,The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
25721,CunninLynguists,And Im trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
25722,CunninLynguists,From the motions of the sea to the color of the dark
25723,CunninLynguists,This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
25724,CunninLynguists,Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
25725,CunninLynguists,I wonder as I wander through my heart
25726,CunninLynguists,Cus it starts a dream defferred
25727,CunninLynguists,A clipped wing on a white dove
25728,CunninLynguists,Seems absurd a smudge on a white glove
25729,CunninLynguists,Not seen nor heard like screams from the nights lungs
25730,CunninLynguists,Cling to words so much that you wont budge
25731,CunninLynguists,Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
25732,CunninLynguists,Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
25733,CunninLynguists,It hits your mind with the right stuff
25734,CunninLynguists,To keep you blind with a slight buzz
25735,CunninLynguists,The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
25736,CunninLynguists,We scuffle through its pieces strugglin for peace its
25737,CunninLynguists,Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
25738,CunninLynguists,The image in my mirror s gettin harder to relate
25739,CunninLynguists,I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
25740,CunninLynguists,But I couldnt be farther from my faith or my face
25741,CunninLynguists,Through this waste of my mind may I find direction
25742,CunninLynguists,Im a waste of my time if I dont find its lessons
25743,CunninLynguists,So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
25744,CunninLynguists,Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
25745,CunninLynguists,As the world twirls on the tip of our index
25746,CunninLynguists,Staring into space one s vision is endless
25747,CunninLynguists,But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is
25748,CunninLynguists,So just close pupils and be pupils and listen
25749,CunninLynguists,The headset s your desk the test is what s missin

25757,CunninLynguists,At that rate the state stay ahead of tomorrow
25758,CunninLynguists,Standing out like mount Kilimanjaro
25759,CunninLynguists,So through this Bluegrass follow sorrow
25760,CunninLynguists,Blacker then the ghetto you fear
25761,CunninLynguists,You disappear like the future of the ghetto you near
25762,CunninLynguists,Where index fingers bring the heavy metal you hear
25763,CunninLynguists,Block stars loading guns as fiends battle for crumbs
25764,CunninLynguists,Come travel through slums try politickin with pushas
25765,CunninLynguists,Made block decisions while mothafuckas overlooked us

25798,CunninLynguists,She speaks no evil but says whatever
25799,CunninLynguists,After Shaking up bed feathers still prays together

25843,CunninLynguists,Turn the page eventually I hit a certain age
25844,CunninLynguists,Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you re afraid
25845,CunninLynguists,Success can often be a perfect cage
25846,CunninLynguists,Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
25847,CunninLynguists,A prisoner trapped in the regret

25876,CunninLynguists,I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
25877,CunninLynguists,Over against my own will surrounded by illusions
25878,CunninLynguists,Fighting to stay positive however losing
25879,CunninLynguists,Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
25880,CunninLynguists,The human heart does more than just pump blood
25881,CunninLynguists,It pumps love at least I know that mine did once
25882,CunninLynguists,But a large piece of it was undone
25883,CunninLynguists,And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
25884,CunninLynguists,Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
25885,CunninLynguists,Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
25886,CunninLynguists,But be certain of your faith and you ll acquire the ability
25887,CunninLynguists,To expose witches and burn them at the stake
25888,CunninLynguists,I m looking for love I m done searching for a date
25889,CunninLynguists,Ive been alone for years but it s worth it if you wait
25890,CunninLynguists,Personally late s better than never at all
25891,CunninLynguists,So when I brush myself off whenever I fall tell me
25892,CunninLynguists,Oh yeah That s what the last one said
25893,CunninLynguists,Unfortunately I was mad misled
25894,CunninLynguists,I ran on E til no more gas was left
25895,CunninLynguists,The most I got from her was ass and bread
25896,CunninLynguists,But trust was lost like Kanye s fashion sense
25897,CunninLynguists,Accidents happen when you live with the weak
25898,CunninLynguists,But it s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
25899,CunninLynguists,That s enough reason to get into beef
25900,CunninLynguists,Throw all your spouse s shit on the street quit  retreat
25901,CunninLynguists,But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
25902,CunninLynguists,So please for my sake stay by me this earth is cold
25903,CunninLynguists,And I m freezing like I ve been lying in dirt and snow
25904,CunninLynguists,I ve searched the globe for a person who knows
25905,CunninLynguists,The true meaning of love you could be the one
25906,CunninLynguists,If you mean what you say we could link up
25907,CunninLynguists,And use what we learned from our exes in the past
25908,CunninLynguists,But wait cause I got another question to ask and that s 
25909,CunninLynguists,Sounds good and if you mean it I ll hook up with you this evening
25910,CunninLynguists,Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
25911,CunninLynguists,The touch of a king when you re my queen
25912,CunninLynguists,And trust is the the key in every relationship
25913,CunninLynguists,But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
25914,CunninLynguists,But looks can be deceiving
25915,CunninLynguists,Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
25916,CunninLynguists,So don t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
25917,CunninLynguists,That s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
25918,CunninLynguists,But the first line of this song already explained
25919,CunninLynguists,That my arteries were drained now all of me is tame
25920,CunninLynguists,So stay beside me cause I don t wanna be estranged
25921,CunninLynguists,As soon as time found them they were saved
25922,CunninLynguists,And still lay there to this day
25923,CunninLynguists,But if this should ever change
25924,CunninLynguists,Just stay and I mma do the same
25925,CunninLynguists,The darkness of the night has gone

25946,CunninLynguists,No brown on the streets where baristas rule
25947,CunninLynguists,And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
25948,CunninLynguists,For the tenants thats in it
25949,CunninLynguists,But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
25950,CunninLynguists,To a brand new prison they can sit til the bars are all  gone 
25951,CunninLynguists,They trying to get us out the hood them people want us  gone 
25952,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone 
25953,CunninLynguists,Crack a Corona just zone while Im sipping on it

25960,CunninLynguists,Now the village full of hellions
25961,CunninLynguists,And the people want rebellion
25962,CunninLynguists,But their Innocence is  gone 
25963,CunninLynguists,And what are we to teach them 
25964,CunninLynguists,When all the grannies are beneath them
25965,CunninLynguists,And the families are divided
25966,CunninLynguists,Searching but I ve been told the silver lining is  gone 
25967,CunninLynguists,This is when fear talks ears off

26273,CunninLynguists,Become infected with feelings so Im electing this evil
26274,CunninLynguists,To end my life without reason cause Im indicted for treason
26275,CunninLynguists,Closin my eyes and Im leakin draggin the knife till Im bleedin
26276,CunninLynguists,Cause its the life that Im seekin feels only right that Im meetin
26277,CunninLynguists,With Jesus seeking redemption but he dont want my repentance
26278,CunninLynguists,For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
26279,CunninLynguists,Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
26280,CunninLynguists,The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessings
26281,CunninLynguists,Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
26282,CunninLynguists,Parents repeatedly sentenced heroin needles on dressers
26283,CunninLynguists,They use to feed their infection I cant repeat indescretions
26284,CunninLynguists,So I pause for reflection long for honest affection
26285,CunninLynguists,And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
26286,CunninLynguists,If you knew where my head is when Im doing these records
26287,CunninLynguists,Youd never listen to my music again I cant let you     
26288,CunninLynguists,I will know how things can be    
26289,CunninLynguists, I want to live a real life     I dont want to dream any longer 
26290,CunninLynguists,If we gonna start from scratch you start with wax
26291,CunninLynguists,If theres no dish then theres no rap
26292,CunninLynguists,Records albums vinyl the facts
26293,CunninLynguists,Give us a stack of records and well give you   tracks
26294,CunninLynguists,The agreement turned cement
26295,CunninLynguists,Hip Hop the vinyl frontier
26296,CunninLynguists,Two turntables a mic and a cold stereo DJ one MC the imperial
26297,CunninLynguists,Many many put their muse to it
26298,CunninLynguists,Sent bop sent rock sent blues through it
26299,CunninLynguists,From classical to jazz we can who s who it
26300,CunninLynguists,Or blow the dust off and groove to it
26301,CunninLynguists,You know that crackle give the best high
26302,CunninLynguists,Give me a needle a cartridge a partridge some tree   s and a    let it be
26303,CunninLynguists,A new format hit the scene like way back
26304,CunninLynguists,It was smaller and more convenient than   track
26305,CunninLynguists,You could pop it in your car on a long drive
26306,CunninLynguists,Play the album or fast forward to song five
26307,CunninLynguists,If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
26308,CunninLynguists,It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
26309,CunninLynguists,Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
26310,CunninLynguists,When they was on the air I was on the pause button
26311,CunninLynguists,I had the best taste but I aint trying to cause nothing
26312,CunninLynguists,Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws
26313,CunninLynguists,Cats used to battle this shit used to cause wars
26314,CunninLynguists,We would trade tapes that was the best it could be
26315,CunninLynguists,Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
26316,CunninLynguists,Having the best tapes was like a status symbol
26317,CunninLynguists,The yellow tape purple tape to the baddest demo
26318,CunninLynguists,Battles travel from the Bronx to Baltimore
26319,CunninLynguists,They would stand by the speaker to record them all
26320,CunninLynguists,Them same tapes that was labeled with a thick marker
26321,CunninLynguists,Made the neighbourhood rappers want to spit sharper
26322,CunninLynguists,If my tape pop trust I was ready man
26323,CunninLynguists,A razor blade scotch tape and a steady hand
26324,CunninLynguists,My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life
26325,CunninLynguists,My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle
26326,CunninLynguists,Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the beat
26327,CunninLynguists,Stab the repeat button and keep running
26328,CunninLynguists,And thats something you cant get from tape dubbing
26329,CunninLynguists,Skip the skips with a flick of the wrist
26330,CunninLynguists,More time to check whats sick on the list
26331,CunninLynguists,The fickle dismissed this little digital disk
26332,CunninLynguists,But try and play vinyl in the whip itll skip
26333,CunninLynguists,And its    Im trying to get laid now
26334,CunninLynguists,Chose the format with binary laid down
26335,CunninLynguists, s and  s and  s and  s flood the BOSE with flows and drums
26336,CunninLynguists,Blunts get blown in my homies truck
26337,CunninLynguists,We sitting on chrome little bone thugs

26340,CunninLynguists,Follow me entering this digital odyssey
26341,CunninLynguists,Holy matrimony but harder to see
26342,CunninLynguists,Everywhere but non existant what a conundrum
26343,CunninLynguists,Upgraded but they say we forgot where we come from
26344,CunninLynguists,The past feels even further with every second
26345,CunninLynguists,Off the record the coming and going of Kbps
26346,CunninLynguists,In the day of the instant message
26347,CunninLynguists,The message is misdirected and the receiver seems to be disconnected
26348,CunninLynguists,But dont complain love game
26349,CunninLynguists,Even after the flood came and left our neighbors over saturated
26350,CunninLynguists,With no computer love just computer bugs
26351,CunninLynguists,Hate the virus and not the hacker thats what a loser does
26352,CunninLynguists,Meanwhile the kids are playing shoot em ups

26364,CunninLynguists,They got slingshots and crossbows and other types of weapons
26365,CunninLynguists,Camouflage vests and fully stocked with the lead
26366,CunninLynguists,Next aisle over I can go fishing instead
26367,CunninLynguists,And to the fake ones your salaries low

26444,CunninLynguists,Rose petals pedaled within cities of stone
26445,CunninLynguists,Reefer and liquor dance my chemical romance
26446,CunninLynguists,Like a tux with gold cuffs that waits to be worn
26447,CunninLynguists,Loves in the haze of a flashback
26448,CunninLynguists,Those that invest deeply need be gettin they cash back
26449,CunninLynguists,Being in lust with love feels so dreamy

26452,CunninLynguists,I just don t think it s as instant as an instance on tv
26453,CunninLynguists,We try to close the distance but persistence ain t easy
26454,CunninLynguists,There s a ribbon in the sky if you listen to Stevie

26457,CunninLynguists,With the wings of a goose mixed with red bull
26458,CunninLynguists,And a night cap slapped on to keep my head cool
26459,CunninLynguists,Awaken in a state of confusion
26460,CunninLynguists,Dressing quickly to get back to my city
26461,CunninLynguists,I ve seen all the things that pass me by

26485,CunninLynguists,Made it rain while we singles so emotionally spent
26486,CunninLynguists,While building our house of love she came short on the rent
26487,CunninLynguists,Fell head over heels but couldnt feel the decent

26527,CunninLynguists,If youve experienced everything except a purpose
26528,CunninLynguists,Then youve missed everything that was meant to be caught

26530,CunninLynguists,You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter
26531,CunninLynguists,In the field we choose to scatter like lice
26532,CunninLynguists,Instead of coming together and keeping it tight
26533,CunninLynguists,Its hard to be alone deep in the night
26534,CunninLynguists,I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
26535,CunninLynguists,But so many times I fall in between the lines
26536,CunninLynguists,Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
26537,CunninLynguists,If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight
26538,CunninLynguists,You might as well freebase on pipes

26551,CunninLynguists,Sometimes I ask myself a question
26552,CunninLynguists,Is my lack of inner reflection
26553,CunninLynguists,Some type of indication of what state my life is in 
26554,CunninLynguists,They keep piping in elevator music
26555,CunninLynguists,Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
26556,CunninLynguists,When I reflect back and recollect that
26557,CunninLynguists,I was born into the state of walking slumber
26558,CunninLynguists,Taught numbers realize Im dirt poor
26559,CunninLynguists,It hurts more now that Im older
26560,CunninLynguists,Showered in water much colder than this

26563,CunninLynguists,Talk about an identity crisis
26564,CunninLynguists,My third eye remains sightless
26565,CunninLynguists,Contemplate fights with vice grips

26570,CunninLynguists,Its not fair the way you challenge me
26571,CunninLynguists,Or the silent way my talents be
26572,CunninLynguists,Hidden inside these translations
26573,CunninLynguists,Emancipation as I try to dab the slate clean
26574,CunninLynguists,Futile attempts to make my fate glean
26575,CunninLynguists,It makes me want to fall reclusive
26576,CunninLynguists,And rip the tallest loose leaf
77790,Logic,I feel like Im out of my mind

79894,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me

79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
79928,Logic,And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
79929,Logic,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
79930,Logic,We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
79931,Logic,We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
79932,Logic,Starting with mental health
79933,Logic,We will accept ourselves as we are
79934,Logic,And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror

80828,Logic,We d like to be painters we d like to be poets We d like to be writers but as everybody knows we can t earn any money that way What do you want to do When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do I will say to him you do that and uhm forget the money If you say that getting the money is the most important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time   
80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

80882,Logic,You were my best friend but then you out me
80883,Logic,I never gave you a reason not to trust me but then you doubt me

80886,Logic,I write it so that the people can feel better
80887,Logic,That have gone through what Ive gone through
80888,Logic,Memories of a perfect love thats broken and haunt you

80890,Logic,I dont want you I want the memory of who you were and what it was to wake up everyday
80891,Logic,And have an endless love with an angel from up above
80892,Logic,But now it would seem my baby girl has fallen
80893,Logic,And another path within my life is calling
