55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
55301,J Cole,Thats the way I wished my family lived
55302,J Cole,But my granny crib was in the jects 
55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only
55313,J Cole,Dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro

56320,J Cole,When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
56321,J Cole,Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
56323,J Cole,Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
56324,J Cole,Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he

56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him

56329,J Cole,Into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
56330,J Cole,Maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas

56352,J Cole,I write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
56353,J Cole,But in a sense I can relate the need to be great
56354,J Cole,Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
56355,J Cole,Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me 
56359,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

56366,J Cole,Bout who they are and why they do this
56367,J Cole,Guess Im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
56368,J Cole,My highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
56369,J Cole,Ive seen in my life I be fiendin to write
56370,J Cole,Songs that raise the hair on my arms
56371,J Cole,My lowest moments came from tryin too hard
56372,J Cole,To impress some niggas that couldnt care if Im on
56373,J Cole,Therefore from here on out my hair grow out
56374,J Cole,I care nothin bout opinions

70458,Kendrick Lamar,Im fortunate you believe in a dream
70459,Kendrick Lamar,This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
70460,Kendrick Lamar,And last night was just another distraction
70461,Kendrick Lamar,Or a reaction of what we consider madness
70462,Kendrick Lamar,I know exactly what happened
70463,Kendrick Lamar,You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
70464,Kendrick Lamar,Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
70465,Kendrick Lamar,Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
70466,Kendrick Lamar,But the type of bullet that stuck
70467,Kendrick Lamar,Had went against his will as blood spilled on your hands
70468,Kendrick Lamar,My plans rather vindictive
70469,Kendrick Lamar,Everybodys a victim in my eyes

70472,Kendrick Lamar,A demon glued to my back whispering  Get em  
70473,Kendrick Lamar,I got em and I aint give a fuck
70474,Kendrick Lamar,That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
70475,Kendrick Lamar,In actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors
70476,Kendrick Lamar,I wonder if Ill ever discover a passion like you and recover
70477,Kendrick Lamar,The life that I knew as a youngin

70510,Kendrick Lamar,Back to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
70511,Kendrick Lamar,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
70512,Kendrick Lamar,Or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
70513,Kendrick Lamar,Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught
70514,Kendrick Lamar,Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed

70519,Kendrick Lamar,And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song
70520,Kendrick Lamar,Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
70521,Kendrick Lamar,And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great 
70522,Kendrick Lamar,A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
70523,Kendrick Lamar,Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
70524,Kendrick Lamar,Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
70525,Kendrick Lamar,And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get it or die tryin

70541,Kendrick Lamar,If its today I hope I hear a
70542,Kendrick Lamar,Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
70543,Kendrick Lamar,With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
70544,Kendrick Lamar,I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin

70546,Kendrick Lamar,With the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
70547,Kendrick Lamar,May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
70548,Kendrick Lamar,And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
70549,Kendrick Lamar,And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
70550,Kendrick Lamar,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
70551,Kendrick Lamar,That can come about  cause the tongue is mighty powerful
70552,Kendrick Lamar,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch

71138,Kendrick Lamar,As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
71139,Kendrick Lamar,And if you riding with me nigga let me ask this question nigga
71140,Kendrick Lamar, I remember you was conflicted
71141,Kendrick Lamar,Abusing my power full of resentment
71142,Kendrick Lamar,Resentment that turned into a deep depression
71143,Kendrick Lamar,Found myself screaming in the hotel room
71144,Kendrick Lamar,I didn t wanna self destruct
71145,Kendrick Lamar,The evils of Lucy was all around me
71146,Kendrick Lamar,So I went running for answers
71147,Kendrick Lamar,But that didn t stop survivor s guilt
71148,Kendrick Lamar,Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
71149,Kendrick Lamar,Or maybe how A  my foundation was
71150,Kendrick Lamar,But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
71151,Kendrick Lamar,A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
71152,Kendrick Lamar,Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
71153,Kendrick Lamar,Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
71154,Kendrick Lamar,Doesn t mean I can t respect you as a black man
71155,Kendrick Lamar,Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
71156,Kendrick Lamar,If I respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us

71246,Kendrick Lamar,Describing my world it says 
71247,Kendrick Lamar, The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
71248,Kendrick Lamar,Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
71249,Kendrick Lamar,In order to protect itself from this mad city
71250,Kendrick Lamar,While consuming its environment
71251,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
71252,Kendrick Lamar,One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
71258,Kendrick Lamar,Already surrounded by this mad city
71259,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
71260,Kendrick Lamar,Which institutionalizes him
71261,Kendrick Lamar,He can no longer see past his own thoughts
71262,Kendrick Lamar,When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
71263,Kendrick Lamar,Going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
71264,Kendrick Lamar,Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
71265,Kendrick Lamar,Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
71266,Kendrick Lamar,That the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
71267,Kendrick Lamar,Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
71268,Kendrick Lamar,They are one and the same 
71269,Kendrick Lamar,What s your perspective on that
