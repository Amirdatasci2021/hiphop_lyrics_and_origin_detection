47474,Ice Cube,How to survive in South Central  what you do  
47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive
47487,Ice Cube,Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles 
47488,Ice Cube,Or has somebody taken your things 
47489,Ice Cube,Have you witnessed a driveby

47499,Ice Cube,In either L A  Compton or Watts
47500,Ice Cube,Pissed off black human beings
47501,Ice Cube,So I think you better skip the sight seeing
47502,Ice Cube,And if youre nuttin but a mark
47503,Ice Cube,Make sure that youre in before dark
47504,Ice Cube,But if you need some affection mate

47523,Ice Cube,To an undercover or the wrong brother
47524,Ice Cube,And theyll smother a out of town motherfucker

47896,Ice Cube,I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross
47897,Ice Cube,Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
47898,Ice Cube,Thinkin should I peel his cap or should I let him survive
47899,Ice Cube,Yo Im trapped in the plan designed by another side
47900,Ice Cube,I aint contributin to genocide  why  
47901,Ice Cube,Niggas in the hood aint changed
47902,Ice Cube,And Ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang

47909,Ice Cube,I understand how all my homeboys feel
47910,Ice Cube,Cuz I been shot to this day I pack my steel
47911,Ice Cube,Cuz I was born in a certain territory
47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep
47915,Ice Cube,Cuz me and T bone we pay it no mind
