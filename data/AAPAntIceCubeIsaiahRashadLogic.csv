47901,Ice Cube,Niggas in the hood aint changed
47902,Ice Cube,And Ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang

47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep

47928,Ice Cube,But when I do gotta put my gat in his mouth
47929,Ice Cube,Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
47930,Ice Cube,Cause the shit he did was uncalled for

79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
79925,Logic,Just like you the person I wrote this for
79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
79928,Logic,And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
79929,Logic,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
79930,Logic,We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
79931,Logic,We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
79932,Logic,Starting with mental health
79933,Logic,We will accept ourselves as we are
79934,Logic,And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror

80826,Logic,Who am I so high  so high 
80827,Logic,I said they wonder who am I so high
80828,Logic,We d like to be painters we d like to be poets We d like to be writers but as everybody knows we can t earn any money that way What do you want to do When we finally got down to something which the individual says he really wants to do I will say to him you do that and uhm forget the money If you say that getting the money is the most important thing you will spend your life completely wasting your time   
80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

81599,Logic,Its hell of a long way from back in the basement
81600,Logic,Looking at hip hop tryna find my placement
81601,Logic,I bought my first pair of Jordans at   
81602,Logic,Same year I bought a crib too
81603,Logic,Now my face in magazines I used to flip through
81604,Logic,And my music on all the sites I used to sift through
81605,Logic,Remember meeting Nas for the first time
81606,Logic,Shook his hand and he started quoting my lines
81607,Logic,Said he a fan goddamn this is my time
81608,Logic,Ima get it Ima do it till we prime time
81609,Logic,I told him every single day that I be at it

81626,Logic,Instead of my talent man these motherfuckers been wrong
81627,Logic,But its all good I just thought Id address it
81628,Logic,And spell it out for people so they can finally assess it
81629,Logic,This is dedicated to anyone with a dream
81630,Logic,And a realization of what following it means
81631,Logic,Breaking the cycle and not following your genes
81632,Logic,That perfect moment when your logic intervenes
81633,Logic,And let you know that everything aint always what it seems
81634,Logic,But if you really looking I promise youll find your dreams
81635,Logic,This is everything I ever wanted half of yall wont get it
81636,Logic,The other half will probably laugh and wonder how I did it
81637,Logic,I just spit it from my mind one word at the time
81638,Logic,Take everything Im going through and put it in a rhyme
81639,Logic,Id be lying if I said I didnt have a lot of weight upon my shoulders
81640,Logic,But this is my therapy as I flow this
81641,Logic,Spilling out my heart I just hope somebody notice
81642,Logic,Ive been real from the start and you motherfuckers know this
81643,Logic,Once my name elevated thats when the fame escalated
81644,Logic,But on the real Ive grown accustomed to the stares

81938,Logic,Drop the politics and bring us together again
81939,Logic,Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then
81940,Logic,Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then yeah yeah
81941,Logic,But Im not defined by the sales of my first week
81942,Logic,Cause in my mind the only way I fail if my verse weak
81943,Logic,As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
81944,Logic,Compiled of different races gathering from different places
81945,Logic,I just contemplate shout out to those who can relate
81946,Logic,And even though it gets hard I know my fate
81947,Logic,With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
81948,Logic,Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates its like
