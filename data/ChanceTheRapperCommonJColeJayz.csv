22402,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22403,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me
22404,Common,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn
22405,Common,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
22406,Common,Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
22407,Common,Ive finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
22408,Common,Cause its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place
22409,Common,So I try to find the clue in you
22410,Common,But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
22411,Common,Whyre we being lied to I aint know our history was purposely hidden
22412,Common,Damn something in me wanna know who I am

22423,Common,And its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
22424,Common,He still created with the imperfection of man
22425,Common,So with following I disagree
22426,Common,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but
22427,Common,I do know the Devil aint no White man the Devils a spiritual mind
22428,Common,Thats color blind theres evil White folk and evil niggas

55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib

55302,J Cole,But my granny crib was in the jects 
55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only
55313,J Cole,Dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro

56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe

56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him

57930,J Cole,I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors see
57931,J Cole,If we destroy the system that means well have less of greed
57932,J Cole,But see its not that simple
57933,J Cole,I got to thinkin about the history of human nature
57934,J Cole,While this instrumental played
57935,J Cole,Then I realized somethin that made
57936,J Cole,Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
57937,J Cole,Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
57938,J Cole,Think about this shit for a second you heard the way
57939,J Cole,The children in abusive households grow up
57940,J Cole,Knockin girlfriends out cold thats called a cycle
57941,J Cole,Abused becomes the abuser and thats just how life go
57942,J Cole,You get the power but you know what power does to man 
57943,J Cole,Corruption always leads us to the same shit again
57944,J Cole,So when you talk bout revolution

57963,J Cole,But sadly in reality dog I dont even know her
57964,J Cole,But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
57965,J Cole,With the thoughts of what she might be like
57966,J Cole,Time after time after time I had to wait and
57967,J Cole,I can take it cause I might be right cause its 
57968,J Cole,This is the girl of my dreams
