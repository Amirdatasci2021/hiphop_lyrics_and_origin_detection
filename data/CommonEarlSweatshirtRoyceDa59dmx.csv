22376,Common,Some say that God is Black and the devils White
22377,Common,Well the devil is wrong and God is whats right
22378,Common,I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
22379,Common,The rain aint gone but I can still see clear
22380,Common,As a child given religion with no answer to why
22381,Common,Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
22382,Common,Curiosity killed the catechism
22383,Common,Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
22384,Common,And became a slave to master self
22385,Common,A rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health
22386,Common,My mind had dealt with the books of Zen Tao the lessons
22387,Common,Quran and the Bible to me they all vital
22388,Common,And got truth within em gotta read them boys
22389,Common,You just cant skim em different branches of belief
22390,Common,But one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em
22391,Common,And use religion as an emblem
22392,Common,When it should be a natural way of life
22393,Common,Who am I or they to say to whom you pray aint right
22394,Common,Thats who got you doing right and got you this far
22395,Common,Whether you say  in Jesus name or  Hum do Allah 
22396,Common,Long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you
22397,Common,You let that show towards others in the things you do
22398,Common,Cause when the trumpets blowin   elders surround the throne
22399,Common,Only        gon get it baby
22400,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22401,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22402,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22403,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me
22404,Common,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn
22405,Common,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
22406,Common,Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
22407,Common,Ive finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
22408,Common,Cause its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place
22409,Common,So I try to find the clue in you
22410,Common,But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
22411,Common,Whyre we being lied to I aint know our history was purposely hidden
22412,Common,Damn something in me wanna know who I am
22413,Common,So I began my search my journey started in church
22414,Common,It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
22415,Common,Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
22416,Common,Taught me survival from this evil Im just gonna have to deal with
22417,Common,And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
22418,Common,It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
22419,Common,Takin elder advice read the Bible the Koran
22420,Common,Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
22421,Common,Hold on this aint right Jesus wasnt White
22422,Common,Some leads were granted with insight
22423,Common,And its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
22424,Common,He still created with the imperfection of man
22425,Common,So with following I disagree
22426,Common,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but
22427,Common,I do know the Devil aint no White man the Devils a spiritual mind
22428,Common,Thats color blind theres evil White folk and evil niggas
22429,Common,You gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity
22430,Common,But one side you gonna have to choose
22431,Common,Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
22432,Common,So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
22433,Common,Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cant follow your lesson
22434,Common,If a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown
22435,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22436,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22437,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22438,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22439,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22440,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22441,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me

105338,Royce Da 59,I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
105339,Royce Da 59,I started out as a battle rapper
105340,Royce Da 59,All I knew was Maxells ADATs DATs and gats
105341,Royce Da 59,Uh my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
105342,Royce Da 59,Recovering alcoholic I grew up on  Mile
105343,Royce Da 59,Uh Im not a gangster drug dealer or thug nigga
105344,Royce Da 59,Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
105345,Royce Da 59,Now sometime around   I found my calling
105346,Royce Da 59,And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
105347,Royce Da 59,Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
105348,Royce Da 59,But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
105349,Royce Da 59,My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
105350,Royce Da 59,Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
105351,Royce Da 59,My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
105352,Royce Da 59,And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah
105353,Royce Da 59,Aye yall remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called 
105354,Royce Da 59,Sean Price be like  Im not sure any  yeah that was my shit
105355,Royce Da 59,I used to bump that shit all day 
105356,Royce Da 59,By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
105357,Royce Da 59,I didnt want to be anything else
105358,Royce Da 59,You know but my mom had plans for me
105359,Royce Da 59,She wanted me to go to school so you know
105360,Royce Da 59,Uh to make moms happy I took some general courses in college
105361,Royce Da 59,Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
105362,Royce Da 59,Because the bus stop I had to walk to
105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
105374,Royce Da 59,Needless to say that December   th was the day I became a believer in fate
105375,Royce Da 59,Okay now its December   th my day has gone great
105376,Royce Da 59,Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
105377,Royce Da 59,I got a call from my girls people saying shes in labor
105378,Royce Da 59,In the hospital right now  th floor
105379,Royce Da 59,I get on the elevator elevator stops on the  th floor
105380,Royce Da 59,Elevator opens up my uncles standing there crying

105383,Royce Da 59,I walk out I see my momma and that entire side of my family

105386,Royce Da 59,And it aint looking good  Im like  Man what  
105387,Royce Da 59,Im having a baby four floors up before I froze up
105388,Royce Da 59,Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
105389,Royce Da 59,Or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see 
105392,Royce Da 59,I walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son
105393,Royce Da 59,Get to my girl she  centimeters dilated so I waited
105394,Royce Da 59,She got to get to bout nine til its that time
105395,Royce Da 59,And meanwhile Im more popular in this hospital than the doctors
105396,Royce Da 59,Nurses watching whispering like  Thats the one right there
105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show
105399,Royce Da 59,Somebody had to remind me the doors was already open at the venue
105400,Royce Da 59,I got emotions runnin every which way
105401,Royce Da 59,All the nurses and stuff is like  Well keep you posted about the baby
105402,Royce Da 59,Well keep you posted about your granny  
105403,Royce Da 59,I didnt like seeing my mama like that so I had to get out of there
105404,Royce Da 59,Yeah I hit the stage at       killed it
105405,Royce Da 59,I got off at about midnight with about six types
105406,Royce Da 59,Of different emotions floatin around inside me
105407,Royce Da 59,Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out
105409,Royce Da 59,I saw Kino talkin to Marshall and then he introduced us
105410,Royce Da 59,We talked about collaboratin and how chasin this rap thing is aggravatin
105411,Royce Da 59,But Ill get back I got the family waitin
105412,Royce Da 59,As soon as I get to the hospital they tell me that my granny didnt make it
105413,Royce Da 59,She just died Im feelin helpless it hurt me
105414,Royce Da 59,On the flip side my little boy is healthy in the nursery

105416,Royce Da 59,Aint no denyin this is the power of God

105424,Royce Da 59,My grandma didnt live anywhere near that hospital
105425,Royce Da 59,I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
105428,Royce Da 59,It showed me that God is real God is real
