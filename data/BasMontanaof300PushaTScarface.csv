110693,Scarface,Through a replica of reality tryin to make it life like
110694,Scarface,But yet and still I let my son be a kid
110695,Scarface,Just give him up the real exactly like my momma did

110727,Scarface,And everyday we face to face with death
110728,Scarface,I seen my homies go and come
110729,Scarface,And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from
110730,Scarface,So I know my numbers comin up
110731,Scarface,So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin up
110732,Scarface,And even though I hate killin off my own kind
110733,Scarface,I gotta be a man and as a man Im a defend mine
110734,Scarface,My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
110735,Scarface,Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
110736,Scarface,So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
110737,Scarface,Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit
110738,Scarface,And the cops is in the same vote
110739,Scarface,Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
110740,Scarface,They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
110741,Scarface,They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
110742,Scarface,And now the storys all twisted up
110743,Scarface,And if they gave the cop the chair
110744,Scarface,I really wouldnt give a fuck
110745,Scarface,Because she left my partners family with memories
110746,Scarface,And after hearin this I know you gon remember me
110747,Scarface,But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
110748,Scarface,I see his parents and then I started breakin up
110749,Scarface,Because I know what you did was wrong
110750,Scarface,But you wont realize until you dead and gone
110751,Scarface,It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
110752,Scarface,You straight up shot him from behind
110753,Scarface,But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
110758,Scarface,Then in reality you took care of your business
110759,Scarface,But regardless I know you wanna kill me
110760,Scarface,But I aint goin out like dat

111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
