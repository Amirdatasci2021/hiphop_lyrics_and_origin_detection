23514,CunninLynguists,Love aint for the faint of heart
23515,CunninLynguists,Start training this game is hard
23516,CunninLynguists,And arduous youre gonna play in the dark like when it rains in the park
23517,CunninLynguists,Youre hardly conscious of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic
23518,CunninLynguists,To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
23519,CunninLynguists,Now youre working yourself out the same as when you strain with a nautilus
23520,CunninLynguists,And youre willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
23521,CunninLynguists,If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
23522,CunninLynguists,Then do you really regret when youve shredded your promises 
23523,CunninLynguists,Now Ive tested the waters kid Sipped it rippled the pond a bit
23524,CunninLynguists,Visits have been abolished and this shits killing my confidence
23525,CunninLynguists,Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment 
23526,CunninLynguists,If you miss chicks when theyre around the phrase  Lets quit isnt an option
23527,CunninLynguists,You best fix whatevers wrong and just move on and get on with it
23528,CunninLynguists,Cause Youll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
23529,CunninLynguists,Its sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch
23530,CunninLynguists,When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
23531,CunninLynguists,Cause It isnt really my time is it Shit I just found the watch
23532,CunninLynguists,But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock
23533,CunninLynguists,And I cant die without trying my hands tied in knots
23534,CunninLynguists,Knowing that Ill never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
23535,CunninLynguists,Love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of
23536,CunninLynguists,Death  its as massive a shock
23537,CunninLynguists,And to intellects its a fuckin smack in the crotch
23538,CunninLynguists,Its a cancer that rots your soul tosses demons off of the road
23539,CunninLynguists,Just use caution and know that love aint nothing but a loss of control
23540,CunninLynguists,Lovell have you nervous doing stupid shit on purpose
23541,CunninLynguists,Brain out of service words slurred when you blurt shit
23542,CunninLynguists,Studderin utterin non sensical shit in your verses
23543,CunninLynguists,Feeling like a shirtless four breasted woman in a circus
23544,CunninLynguists,Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
23545,CunninLynguists,Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
23546,CunninLynguists,So girls create a false world of filling on boys
23547,CunninLynguists,Exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
23548,CunninLynguists,But when you have it theres nothing like it you get excited
23549,CunninLynguists,Seeking those who provide it on phones talking to psychics
23550,CunninLynguists,Some fear it spend their entire lives trying to fight it
23551,CunninLynguists,Living in a confusing Hayes like theyre grooving to Isaac
23552,CunninLynguists,It aint the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
23553,CunninLynguists,It aint easily learnable with definitions in tact
23554,CunninLynguists,It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
23555,CunninLynguists,Hittin and bullwhippin you leavin them slits in your back
23556,CunninLynguists,But Ive been a lucky one loving parents loving friends
23557,CunninLynguists,But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
23558,CunninLynguists,But I aint a genius on it I can only pretend
23559,CunninLynguists,Cause over all its an emotion I cannot comprehend
23560,CunninLynguists,Love aint the basis for action
23561,CunninLynguists,In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
23562,CunninLynguists,Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
23563,CunninLynguists,Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
23564,CunninLynguists,And the past isnt felt as a match made in hell
23565,CunninLynguists,But rather its held as a latter day meld
23566,CunninLynguists,Of common mistakes and nice intentions
23567,CunninLynguists,But when false love retention is simply vice invention
23568,CunninLynguists,Its only right to mention the fights you get in
23569,CunninLynguists,Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
23570,CunninLynguists,So whats love really got to do with it 
23571,CunninLynguists,From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
23572,CunninLynguists,The truth isnt as eloquent so be intelligent
23573,CunninLynguists,Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of its irrelevant
23574,CunninLynguists,And that wordll fit like a glove if you dont get right
23575,CunninLynguists,Now live your life for the love or stop
23576,CunninLynguists, So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin 
23577,CunninLynguists, Yeah Why dont you rap for food then  
23578,CunninLynguists,Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef
23579,CunninLynguists,Similar to Christ  we got divine reps so tell me 
23580,CunninLynguists,If you know your gwan die  why step  
23581,CunninLynguists,Show no mercy  when bruising crews 
23582,CunninLynguists,You get hit with more bricks than New Jerus
23583,CunninLynguists, Riddles confusing fools like Confucian rules
23584,CunninLynguists, Cause most cats are more squared than Rubiks Cubes 
23585,CunninLynguists,We spit raps that are totally murderous
23586,CunninLynguists, The rhymes are like an anaconda serpent clutch 
23587,CunninLynguists,So check out how these herbs get touched
23588,CunninLynguists, Unless your broads giving us brains  nigga you aint servin us
23589,CunninLynguists, Deacon and Kno  cunning lynguists with stunning English
23590,CunninLynguists, Our true lies bring more pumps than Harry Renquist
23591,CunninLynguists, Every week with the best speech

23999,CunninLynguists,Burned bridges occurred from scriptin my words
24000,CunninLynguists,Word so Ill chisel a verse
24001,CunninLynguists,On these lie filled halls that Ive lived in and searched

24008,CunninLynguists,Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
24009,CunninLynguists,Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
24010,CunninLynguists,A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
24011,CunninLynguists,Life is like a lion and Im dying at its feet
24012,CunninLynguists,I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
24013,CunninLynguists,Ive seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B roll
24014,CunninLynguists,My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
24015,CunninLynguists,And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
24016,CunninLynguists,My memory banks the only thing I tend to rob
24017,CunninLynguists,And every time I phone the lob Im out of dodge
24018,CunninLynguists,Its hard on the boulevard and other clich s

24030,CunninLynguists,In a flood of shadow puppetry something in the air
24031,CunninLynguists,Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self aware
24032,CunninLynguists,Its recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
24033,CunninLynguists,Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
24034,CunninLynguists,Close encounters exacerbate his condition

24089,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24090,CunninLynguists,There was a time when I couldnt find energy
24091,CunninLynguists,The only person that was feelin me was Mrs Hennessy
24092,CunninLynguists,Its like life was pinnin me down
24093,CunninLynguists,I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
24094,CunninLynguists,You aint gonna be a rapper youre not a factor
24095,CunninLynguists,You just a Kentucky boy get yourself a tractor
24096,CunninLynguists,Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
24097,CunninLynguists,Thats when the liquor and weed became a need
24098,CunninLynguists,Self esteem was lower than snorkel cities
24099,CunninLynguists,Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel s titties
24100,CunninLynguists,Then as soon as I started getting some pride
24101,CunninLynguists,My sister hydroplaned and died on I   
24102,CunninLynguists,In a family full of pride house full of tears
24103,CunninLynguists,Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
24104,CunninLynguists,Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
24105,CunninLynguists,Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
24106,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24107,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24108,CunninLynguists,I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
24109,CunninLynguists,And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
24110,CunninLynguists,Cant grow fond of past memories
24111,CunninLynguists,Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
24112,CunninLynguists,Offended by the mental imagery
24113,CunninLynguists,And suggest livin in poverty was really meant for me
24114,CunninLynguists,Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
24115,CunninLynguists,Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
24116,CunninLynguists,I cant begin to see how to control the flash backs
24117,CunninLynguists,Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
24118,CunninLynguists,Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
24119,CunninLynguists,When I dont perceive what I feel I deserve
24120,CunninLynguists,Being slurred by those not livin in my position
24121,CunninLynguists,My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
24122,CunninLynguists,And when I thought Id risen life freezes the frame
24123,CunninLynguists,So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain
24124,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24125,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24126,CunninLynguists,I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
24127,CunninLynguists,Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
24128,CunninLynguists,You know what blasphemys like cursing at God
24129,CunninLynguists,Cause you aint got shit it hurts and its hard
24130,CunninLynguists,Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
24131,CunninLynguists,Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
24132,CunninLynguists,Most of my lifes a daze got me forever lighting haze
24133,CunninLynguists,Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
24134,CunninLynguists,For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
24135,CunninLynguists,Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
24136,CunninLynguists,Few friends even then most homies is fake
24137,CunninLynguists,Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
24138,CunninLynguists,I went from the block with my fam to college exams
24139,CunninLynguists,But the pressures still there dog Im still scared
24140,CunninLynguists,But I know it will all be right in the end
24141,CunninLynguists,As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen
24142,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24143,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory

24261,CunninLynguists,They cant even come face to face and share smiles
24262,CunninLynguists,Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
24263,CunninLynguists,Like she spawned a fucking anti Christ or a Satan infant
24264,CunninLynguists,Blatant mentions about family blood wont leave
24265,CunninLynguists,Loves her deeply but evil sends its opposite feed
24266,CunninLynguists,Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
24267,CunninLynguists,If he could just set it aside thered be heaven to pay
24268,CunninLynguists,Then weathered and aged time swept him to grave
24269,CunninLynguists,Love conquers all shit Id say that areas grey
24270,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why   X 
24271,CunninLynguists,Most dont even know why they believe what they believe man

24276,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24277,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg
24278,CunninLynguists,Looking at life in retrospect its hard to regret
24279,CunninLynguists,Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
24280,CunninLynguists,Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
24281,CunninLynguists,Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
24282,CunninLynguists,And even though nobodys life is ever perfect
24283,CunninLynguists,You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
24284,CunninLynguists,Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
24285,CunninLynguists,Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
24286,CunninLynguists,People who pimp children are really raping religion
24287,CunninLynguists,The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
24288,CunninLynguists,But now the technology follows me solemnly
24289,CunninLynguists,Building the future laws to my philosophy
24290,CunninLynguists,Alzheimers cutting through like a lobotomy
24291,CunninLynguists,Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
24292,CunninLynguists,Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
24293,CunninLynguists,I survived disease and political crisis
24294,CunninLynguists,By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
24295,CunninLynguists,And now I live vicariously through my kids
24296,CunninLynguists,Like people who love the sport but cant play for shit
24297,CunninLynguists,Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
24298,CunninLynguists,I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
24299,CunninLynguists,Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
24300,CunninLynguists,But just before I vanish as I think Im at the end
24301,CunninLynguists,The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
24302,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24303,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24304,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24305,CunninLynguists,The world is changing day to day
24306,CunninLynguists,It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
24307,CunninLynguists,Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
24308,CunninLynguists,Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
24309,CunninLynguists,I feel weathered but feel like Ive been driving forever
24310,CunninLynguists,Showin up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
24311,CunninLynguists,Ive been better but all things pass
24312,CunninLynguists,This life is taking everything away but youre provided with your past
24313,CunninLynguists,So fuck it  I stick to having dreams on the road
24314,CunninLynguists,But until this dream is done Im gonna keep my eyes closed
24315,CunninLynguists,And breathe breathe when it snows
24316,CunninLynguists,Breathe when Im forced to live a life with a person on a phone
24317,CunninLynguists,Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin
24318,CunninLynguists,Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
24319,CunninLynguists,Cause after the show when the last star shines
24320,CunninLynguists,I can make this all better when I close my eyes
24321,CunninLynguists,Im in another zone where troubles gone
24322,CunninLynguists,Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
24323,CunninLynguists,A place where life is easy for everybody else
24324,CunninLynguists,I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
24325,CunninLynguists,But we dont know it where we dont show it all
24326,CunninLynguists,For life aint protocol under sky over law
24327,CunninLynguists,Im in another space where all the food is good
24328,CunninLynguists,And theres enough for everybody in my neighborhood
24329,CunninLynguists,Where all the grass is blue where we dont know bout green
24330,CunninLynguists,Cause money aint a thing I pinch myself its not a dream
24331,CunninLynguists,Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
24332,CunninLynguists,If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldnt mean a thing
24333,CunninLynguists,Between climbing and finding it not worth it
24334,CunninLynguists,Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
24335,CunninLynguists,Im so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
24336,CunninLynguists,I think of home when I close my eyes
24337,CunninLynguists,So done with the smokes and fries
24338,CunninLynguists,Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
24339,CunninLynguists,Drinks I shouldnt drink things I never write
24340,CunninLynguists,Cities I never liked now its like aight
24341,CunninLynguists,Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
24342,CunninLynguists,Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
24343,CunninLynguists,My work is love no complaints Im fine
24344,CunninLynguists,Its been a long night cant wait to close my eyes
24345,CunninLynguists,I dream of an industry ego less
24346,CunninLynguists,And free from the modern chains with these chains were so deep in love
24347,CunninLynguists,Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
24348,CunninLynguists,Dreaming a publicist wasnt  Gs a month
24349,CunninLynguists,And where its not about numbers and math
24350,CunninLynguists,And I was content with really just a couple of fans
24351,CunninLynguists,And my happiness wasnt relying on tours and a van
24352,CunninLynguists,Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
24353,CunninLynguists,With the front front row stadium packed
24354,CunninLynguists,And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
24355,CunninLynguists,And scream at them  Look at me now look at me man 
24356,CunninLynguists,Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
24357,CunninLynguists,Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
24358,CunninLynguists,Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
24359,CunninLynguists,I woke up and realized it was a dream
24360,CunninLynguists,Wide awake in the rap game but life Im asleep
24361,CunninLynguists,You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
24362,CunninLynguists,I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
24363,CunninLynguists,Part of my shine comes from the distance
24364,CunninLynguists,You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
24365,CunninLynguists,Is this business emotionally invested 
24366,CunninLynguists,Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
24367,CunninLynguists,Love is war sex is a weapon
24368,CunninLynguists,The mind is a mine so watch where youre steppin
24369,CunninLynguists,Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
24370,CunninLynguists,Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
24371,CunninLynguists,Feelings are just filling in this half baked scene
24372,CunninLynguists,To make x rated into nc   
24373,CunninLynguists,Then see everything she got she not shy
24374,CunninLynguists,Our love below so dro we most high
24375,CunninLynguists,Then wears off when what we wears on
24376,CunninLynguists,Again I turn away when what we shares gone
24377,CunninLynguists,If this is not the hardest part
24378,CunninLynguists,If passion dies within routine
24379,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared
24380,CunninLynguists,Could have been fearless and unprepared
24381,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared

24386,CunninLynguists,Whatever happens after this moments of no concern
24387,CunninLynguists,But its hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
24388,CunninLynguists,Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
24389,CunninLynguists,We wired for desire dangers to ourselves
24390,CunninLynguists,Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
24391,CunninLynguists,My muse sleeps deep within time
24392,CunninLynguists,I go to her for credit though I need to decline
24393,CunninLynguists,Its easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
24394,CunninLynguists,Im sorry its just the way we designed

24408,CunninLynguists,I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
24409,CunninLynguists,Cause when youre gone its just that coffin that you lie stiff in

24412,CunninLynguists,That I made when I was younger way before the hunger
24413,CunninLynguists,Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number

24955,CunninLynguists,From them days in the park alone drinking gin by the cup
24956,CunninLynguists,Through an exitless maze wandering and constantly stuck

24958,CunninLynguists,Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
24959,CunninLynguists,Wasnt selfish with them trying to stretch and contort them
24960,CunninLynguists,And didnt let the world get to them first and distort them
24961,CunninLynguists,So as I  kick back and ponder on armeggedon
24962,CunninLynguists,And I   spit raps about where my life couldve been headin

24972,CunninLynguists,So I dont see that all my enemies resembled me
24973,CunninLynguists,Im feeling faceless heading for a bitter state

25105,CunninLynguists,Like everythings changed and suddenly you dont trust her just the same
25106,CunninLynguists,Then you find out some other mans been fuckin out her brains
25107,CunninLynguists,Thats when your heart starts to feel the pain
25108,CunninLynguists,So much that you can feel it in your veins and you cant forget her name

25121,CunninLynguists,And all of them know Ive never felt this pain in my past
25122,CunninLynguists,And its ironic the first place we made loves the same as the last
25123,CunninLynguists,In the shower    thats why I put the rain with her name
25124,CunninLynguists,And my power to trust someone again has faded away

25126,CunninLynguists,I wallow in my sorrow smoke and watch tapes that we made
25127,CunninLynguists,And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades

25143,CunninLynguists,Many stems like hymns once blossomed from ground
25144,CunninLynguists,But while the reaper is king we carry the crown
25145,CunninLynguists,We weigh it out dreaming screaming or close to even
25146,CunninLynguists,In this sense nobodys perfect nobody is worthless
25147,CunninLynguists,The systems imperfect maybe we should measure in purpose

25160,CunninLynguists,Faith we treat it like a four letter word

25162,CunninLynguists,Hear me my Lord come settle my nerves
25163,CunninLynguists,I pray these words bring honor as the heavens observe
25164,CunninLynguists,And to the sky where the birds will testify

25705,CunninLynguists,Throwing change ups in your medley through headpiece
25706,CunninLynguists,Still Judge but dont Dredd each day instead feast
25707,CunninLynguists,Lifes an unfed beast that eats bread and meat
25708,CunninLynguists,Thats either your cash or your corpse

25710,CunninLynguists,I am floating happy not knowing nautical course
25711,CunninLynguists,Tie a wristwatch in slipknots and dock at my porch
25712,CunninLynguists,Time is of no essence the presence becomes presents
25713,CunninLynguists,Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance
25714,CunninLynguists,Current currencies worthless fodder for feeding purses
25715,CunninLynguists,With iron clad words I solder together verses
25716,CunninLynguists,I m trippin like I m eatin the fungi
25717,CunninLynguists,Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye
25718,CunninLynguists,Theres no light just never ending night
25719,CunninLynguists,And the weathers like a hurricane when land is in its sight
25720,CunninLynguists,The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
25721,CunninLynguists,And Im trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
25722,CunninLynguists,From the motions of the sea to the color of the dark
25723,CunninLynguists,This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
25724,CunninLynguists,Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
25725,CunninLynguists,I wonder as I wander through my heart
25726,CunninLynguists,Cus it starts a dream defferred
25727,CunninLynguists,A clipped wing on a white dove
25728,CunninLynguists,Seems absurd a smudge on a white glove
25729,CunninLynguists,Not seen nor heard like screams from the nights lungs
25730,CunninLynguists,Cling to words so much that you wont budge
25731,CunninLynguists,Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
25732,CunninLynguists,Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
25733,CunninLynguists,It hits your mind with the right stuff
25734,CunninLynguists,To keep you blind with a slight buzz
25735,CunninLynguists,The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
25736,CunninLynguists,We scuffle through its pieces strugglin for peace its
25737,CunninLynguists,Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
25738,CunninLynguists,The image in my mirror s gettin harder to relate
25739,CunninLynguists,I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
25740,CunninLynguists,But I couldnt be farther from my faith or my face
25741,CunninLynguists,Through this waste of my mind may I find direction
25742,CunninLynguists,Im a waste of my time if I dont find its lessons
25743,CunninLynguists,So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
25744,CunninLynguists,Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
25745,CunninLynguists,As the world twirls on the tip of our index
25746,CunninLynguists,Staring into space one s vision is endless
25747,CunninLynguists,But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is
25748,CunninLynguists,So just close pupils and be pupils and listen
25749,CunninLynguists,The headset s your desk the test is what s missin
25750,CunninLynguists,Disect these notes of quotes of keys written
25751,CunninLynguists,Dont worry about this dirty south til its mud floods ya front stoop
25752,CunninLynguists,Aces and acres of haters growing out the same root
25753,CunninLynguists,That hit you quicker than poverty in two major arteries
25754,CunninLynguists,Havin you movin and softshoe in like who made you property
25755,CunninLynguists,Black face and sambos tied for last place
25756,CunninLynguists,Let facts state we like Wildcats in a rat race
25757,CunninLynguists,At that rate the state stay ahead of tomorrow
25758,CunninLynguists,Standing out like mount Kilimanjaro
25759,CunninLynguists,So through this Bluegrass follow sorrow
25760,CunninLynguists,Blacker then the ghetto you fear
25761,CunninLynguists,You disappear like the future of the ghetto you near
25762,CunninLynguists,Where index fingers bring the heavy metal you hear
25763,CunninLynguists,Block stars loading guns as fiends battle for crumbs
25764,CunninLynguists,Come travel through slums try politickin with pushas
25765,CunninLynguists,Made block decisions while mothafuckas overlooked us
25766,CunninLynguists,Under the radar like helicopters on the sly

25795,CunninLynguists,Unless he builds with a female until time stands still
25796,CunninLynguists,When we take off our shells and chill
25797,CunninLynguists,All before fingers learn bodies like we got blindman skill
25798,CunninLynguists,She speaks no evil but says whatever
25799,CunninLynguists,After Shaking up bed feathers still prays together

25837,CunninLynguists,Of those in this winter with no mink or folk
25838,CunninLynguists,Weathering this desert with no drink to cope
25839,CunninLynguists,Some chain smoke with no link or hope
25840,CunninLynguists,You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
25841,CunninLynguists,The fastest can t run from who they are
25842,CunninLynguists,I d run from self but no man can run that far
25843,CunninLynguists,Turn the page eventually I hit a certain age
25844,CunninLynguists,Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you re afraid
25845,CunninLynguists,Success can often be a perfect cage
25846,CunninLynguists,Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
25847,CunninLynguists,A prisoner trapped in the regret

25859,CunninLynguists,I m Bustin Loose no Wilder just a Pryor  prior 
25860,CunninLynguists,And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
25861,CunninLynguists,Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
25862,CunninLynguists,Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
25863,CunninLynguists,Meet a fan kick it witcha take a picture
25864,CunninLynguists,Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister

25875,CunninLynguists,If it would help I d even die for you
25876,CunninLynguists,I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
25877,CunninLynguists,Over against my own will surrounded by illusions
25878,CunninLynguists,Fighting to stay positive however losing
25879,CunninLynguists,Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
25880,CunninLynguists,The human heart does more than just pump blood
25881,CunninLynguists,It pumps love at least I know that mine did once
25882,CunninLynguists,But a large piece of it was undone
25883,CunninLynguists,And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
25884,CunninLynguists,Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
25885,CunninLynguists,Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
25886,CunninLynguists,But be certain of your faith and you ll acquire the ability
25887,CunninLynguists,To expose witches and burn them at the stake
25888,CunninLynguists,I m looking for love I m done searching for a date
25889,CunninLynguists,Ive been alone for years but it s worth it if you wait
25890,CunninLynguists,Personally late s better than never at all
25891,CunninLynguists,So when I brush myself off whenever I fall tell me
25892,CunninLynguists,Oh yeah That s what the last one said
25893,CunninLynguists,Unfortunately I was mad misled
25894,CunninLynguists,I ran on E til no more gas was left
25895,CunninLynguists,The most I got from her was ass and bread
25896,CunninLynguists,But trust was lost like Kanye s fashion sense
25897,CunninLynguists,Accidents happen when you live with the weak
25898,CunninLynguists,But it s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
25899,CunninLynguists,That s enough reason to get into beef
25900,CunninLynguists,Throw all your spouse s shit on the street quit  retreat
25901,CunninLynguists,But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
25902,CunninLynguists,So please for my sake stay by me this earth is cold
25903,CunninLynguists,And I m freezing like I ve been lying in dirt and snow
25904,CunninLynguists,I ve searched the globe for a person who knows
25905,CunninLynguists,The true meaning of love you could be the one
25906,CunninLynguists,If you mean what you say we could link up
25907,CunninLynguists,And use what we learned from our exes in the past
25908,CunninLynguists,But wait cause I got another question to ask and that s 
25909,CunninLynguists,Sounds good and if you mean it I ll hook up with you this evening
25910,CunninLynguists,Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
25911,CunninLynguists,The touch of a king when you re my queen
25912,CunninLynguists,And trust is the the key in every relationship
25913,CunninLynguists,But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
25914,CunninLynguists,But looks can be deceiving
25915,CunninLynguists,Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
25916,CunninLynguists,So don t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
25917,CunninLynguists,That s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
25918,CunninLynguists,But the first line of this song already explained
25919,CunninLynguists,That my arteries were drained now all of me is tame
25920,CunninLynguists,So stay beside me cause I don t wanna be estranged
25921,CunninLynguists,As soon as time found them they were saved
25922,CunninLynguists,And still lay there to this day
25923,CunninLynguists,But if this should ever change
25924,CunninLynguists,Just stay and I mma do the same
25925,CunninLynguists,The darkness of the night has gone

25946,CunninLynguists,No brown on the streets where baristas rule
25947,CunninLynguists,And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
25948,CunninLynguists,For the tenants thats in it
25949,CunninLynguists,But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
25950,CunninLynguists,To a brand new prison they can sit til the bars are all  gone 
25951,CunninLynguists,They trying to get us out the hood them people want us  gone 
25952,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone 
25953,CunninLynguists,Crack a Corona just zone while Im sipping on it

25962,CunninLynguists,But their Innocence is  gone 
25963,CunninLynguists,And what are we to teach them 
25964,CunninLynguists,When all the grannies are beneath them
25965,CunninLynguists,And the families are divided
25966,CunninLynguists,Searching but I ve been told the silver lining is  gone 
25967,CunninLynguists,This is when fear talks ears off
25968,CunninLynguists,Many corporations calculate what a tear cost
25969,CunninLynguists,Morals break down like they biodegradable
25970,CunninLynguists,Too keep the faith or give it up
25971,CunninLynguists,Are the lights that shine in the darkest times  Gone 
25972,CunninLynguists,I m hoping this as bad as it gets
25973,CunninLynguists,They trying to kick us out the hood niggas want us  gone

26277,CunninLynguists,With Jesus seeking redemption but he dont want my repentance
26278,CunninLynguists,For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
26279,CunninLynguists,Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
26280,CunninLynguists,The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessings
26281,CunninLynguists,Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
26282,CunninLynguists,Parents repeatedly sentenced heroin needles on dressers
26283,CunninLynguists,They use to feed their infection I cant repeat indescretions
26284,CunninLynguists,So I pause for reflection long for honest affection
26285,CunninLynguists,And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
26286,CunninLynguists,If you knew where my head is when Im doing these records

26307,CunninLynguists,If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
26308,CunninLynguists,It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
26309,CunninLynguists,Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
26310,CunninLynguists,When they was on the air I was on the pause button
26311,CunninLynguists,I had the best taste but I aint trying to cause nothing

26315,CunninLynguists,Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
26316,CunninLynguists,Having the best tapes was like a status symbol
26317,CunninLynguists,The yellow tape purple tape to the baddest demo

26554,CunninLynguists,They keep piping in elevator music
