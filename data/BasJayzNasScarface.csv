109942,Scarface,Be careful of the choices that you make cause one day
109943,Scarface,Youll be standing on your feet and then the next
109944,Scarface,Youre underneath the sheet greeting death
109945,Scarface,I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
109946,Scarface,Stealing breath shortening my days even less
109947,Scarface,Lost souls never rest a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
109948,Scarface,A adolescent hangs shes depressed
109949,Scarface,A priest who confessed a judged typing a nigga in a text

109955,Scarface,Wait wait wait for my eyes to close
109956,Scarface,Smile on your child so he knows
109957,Scarface,When all that you believed in was a lie
109958,Scarface,Are you willing to accept it when you find out
109959,Scarface,Or try to reason with yourself thats what it is when its not
109960,Scarface,And all the whole while its been a plot
109961,Scarface,To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
109962,Scarface,That they keep us in the dark know they act
109963,Scarface,We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
109964,Scarface,Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasnt that
109965,Scarface,The church and these politics they all full of crap
109966,Scarface,Its a shame but thats how were blaming its for the scratch
109967,Scarface,So I dont knock Im tryna to put a black card in my wallet
109968,Scarface,But some dollars in my pocket aint the topic

109987,Scarface,And when Im high yall I cant explain
109988,Scarface,What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
109989,Scarface,Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

111932,Scarface,When you rolling through yo mutherfuckin hood what do you see 
111933,Scarface,Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
111934,Scarface,Scored a   bag and we hit the spot

111948,Scarface,So aint no muthafuckin thang for me
111949,Scarface,To kill a nigga who aint fuckin with the gang with me
111950,Scarface,Formaldehyde smokin niggas gettin loced and
111951,Scarface,Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
111952,Scarface,Scoping hoping for you to fuck up and slip
111953,Scarface,So we can have a reason for fuckin up your shit
111954,Scarface, It aint no muthafuckin peace when they see me 
111955,Scarface,Cause we never had a muthafuckin peace treaty
111956,Scarface,So I know I got to get em with game
111957,Scarface,And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
111958,Scarface,Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
111959,Scarface,And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
111960,Scarface,I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
111961,Scarface,Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
111962,Scarface,And thats the one that can close the shop
111963,Scarface,So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
111964,Scarface,Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
111965,Scarface,But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see 
111966,Scarface,I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
111967,Scarface,But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
111968,Scarface,And the nigga that tried to pull it
111969,Scarface,If I dont get lean and blowed everyday
111970,Scarface,I feel just like Imma explode on overload and overdrive
111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
111978,Scarface,But to tell the truth I didnt know myself
111979,Scarface,I found out she had to told me
111980,Scarface,Just to show me just how good I had it
111981,Scarface,Mild mannered I just couldnt be it
111982,Scarface,But that was just the way we used to G it
111983,Scarface,One of the wrongest niggas I see
111984,Scarface,Or one of the strongest niggas I know
111985,Scarface,Walkin on my tippy toe cause the life I live aint long and I know
111986,Scarface,So I put weed in the bong and I blow
111987,Scarface,Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
111988,Scarface,Child that grew into a man thats widely respected
111989,Scarface,But that dont stop our pain
111990,Scarface,Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
111991,Scarface,I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
111992,Scarface,These bitch ass niggas shife
111993,Scarface,Niggas might snitch out they momma
111994,Scarface,Thats why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
111995,Scarface,Cause we aint promised tommorow
111996,Scarface,But nigga you promised to die
111997,Scarface,Nigga cant you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
111998,Scarface,At night I talk to God and try to understand
111999,Scarface,How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
112000,Scarface,I guess they already gone aint nothin gone bring them back
112001,Scarface,So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
112002,Scarface,I still love my piece and chain wood grain and big head ones
112003,Scarface,But I had to realize in life everything aint always fun
112004,Scarface,I guess thats true for some
112005,Scarface,But them hoes will never win
112006,Scarface,Out here just hustlin and grindin
112007,Scarface,Tryin to change from niggas to men
