11411,Big L,Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
11412,Big L,Flamboyant is the label Im with motherfucker
11413,Big L,There are too many MCs who are overrated
11414,Big L,You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
11415,Big L,In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
11416,Big L,So give it up become a actor or a actress
11417,Big L,Or a producer cause you fail to use the
11418,Big L,Mic right so take flight before I bruise ya
11419,Big L,For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
11420,Big L,You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
11421,Big L,Hey yo Im serious Big L aint playin games
11422,Big L,I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names
11423,Big L,But deep down inside you know who you are
11424,Big L,Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
11425,Big L,And that really gets on my nerve
11426,Big L,When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
11427,Big L,Goin platinum and dont have no soul
11428,Big L,Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
11429,Big L,I dont like the way its goin down
11430,Big L,Because it should be the other way around
11431,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11432,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11433,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11434,Big L,How MCs take this rap game for granted
11435,Big L,I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
11436,Big L,One minute youre hardcore and raw
11437,Big L,Thats what you was known for but not no more
11438,Big L,You changed you rearranged
11439,Big L,Youre not the same your raps are plain
11440,Big L,That explain why you lost your fame
11441,Big L,Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
11442,Big L,You turned pop now you no longer gain props
11443,Big L,Whos fault is that Nobodys but your own black
11444,Big L,Used to make fat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
11445,Big L,So MCs dont ever step out your range
11446,Big L,And only change with the time
11447,Big L,Unless you get dropped like a dime
11448,Big L,Go for yours like Im goin for mine
11449,Big L,But if youre rough stay rough if youre dap stay dapper
11450,Big L,And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
11451,Big L,Just fulfill your own needs
11452,Big L,Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads 
11453,Big L,This is how it should be done
11454,Big L,Im not the one and my raps is strong like rum
11455,Big L,But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb
11456,Big L,Plus slum  How come  Rap skills they have none
11457,Big L,And I wonder how the hell they records sell
11458,Big L,They raps are stale and frail
11459,Big L,Theyre false like fairy tales
11460,Big L,Your technique and everything you speaks weak
11461,Big L,You got a little airplay because of your beats
11462,Big L,Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
11463,Big L,Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
11464,Big L,Your raps border wack and you went on tour with that
11465,Big L,Crap dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
11466,Big L,I got more soul that Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
11467,Big L,Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs
11468,Big L,But still call themselves MCs
11469,Big L,Some people was born in heaven
11470,Big L,With a silver spoon in they mouth
11471,Big L,And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
11472,Big L,And never had to work hard for nothing
11473,Big L,Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
11474,Big L,Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
11475,Big L,And had to work hard for everything they got
11476,Big L,And never had nothing handed to them   and never will
11477,Big L,And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
11478,Big L,Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
11479,Big L,My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
11480,Big L,Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
11481,Big L,Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
11482,Big L,Too ashamed to walk the streets
11483,Big L,Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
11484,Big L,Even my holidays got damaged
11485,Big L,Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
11486,Big L,And every day I ask myself  How will I make it  
11487,Big L,It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
11488,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11489,Big L,I walk around with a frown I got no reason to smile
11490,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11491,Big L,Aiyo times was rough I had to grow up foul
11492,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11493,Big L,I always knew that Id end up doing time on the Isle
11494,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11495,Big L,Five years passed by now Im at the age of

11499,Big L,Soon I ran into a couple of guns

11501,Big L,Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
11502,Big L,I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
11503,Big L,Then I lost control and started going too far
11504,Big L,Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
11505,Big L,Where I grew up it was a living Hell
11506,Big L,Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
11507,Big L,Now I can sleep now I can eat
11508,Big L,Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
11509,Big L,And every day I ask myself How will I make it 
11510,Big L,Doing time was full of stress G
11511,Big L,All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
11512,Big L,One tried to test me didnt find it humorous
11513,Big L,Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
11514,Big L,My time came to a cease Im back on the streets again

11520,Big L,My whole life was deserted
11521,Big L,Either Ima go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it 
11522,Big L,All I tried to do was live the one life that I got

98603,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98604,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98605,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98606,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98607,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion
98608,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
98609,NF,Theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
98610,NF,Written all over the floors all over the chairs
98611,NF,And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
98612,NF,Thats where I write when Im in a bad place and need to release
98613,NF,And let out the version of NF you dont wanna see
98614,NF,I put holes in the walls with both of my fists til they bleed
98615,NF,You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
98616,NF,Physically abused now thats the room that I dont wanna be in
98617,NF,That picture aint blurry at all I just dont wanna see it
98618,NF,And these walls aint blank I just think I dont wanna see em
98619,NF,But why not Im in here so I might as well read em
98620,NF,I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
98621,NF,Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
98622,NF,Matter of fact I think Ima burn this room right now
98623,NF,Somehow this memory for some reason just wont come down
98624,NF,You used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
98625,NF,Then took me downstairs and beat me til I screamed and I cried
98626,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98627,NF,But Ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
98628,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98629,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98630,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98631,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98632,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98633,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98634,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98635,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
98636,NF,See my problem is I dont fix things I just try to repaint
98637,NF,Cover em up like it never happened say  I wish I could change 
98638,NF,Are you confused Come upstairs and Ill show you what I mean
98639,NF,This rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
98640,NF,The moment I walk into its the same moment that I wanna leave
98641,NF,I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
98642,NF,But its hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
98643,NF,I look around one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
98644,NF,Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
98645,NF,One of the first things I wrote was  I wish I woulda called 
98646,NF,But I should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
98647,NF,And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
98648,NF,And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
98649,NF,Shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
98650,NF,Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
98651,NF,And I regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
98652,NF,And at the rate Im goin theyll probably still be there when I die
98653,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98654,NF,The question is will I ever clean the walls off in time 
98655,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98656,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98657,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98658,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98659,NF,These walls are my blank expression

98662,NF,So this part of my house no ones been in it for years
98663,NF,I built a safe room and I dont let no one in there
98664,NF,Cause if I do theres a chance that they might disappear
98665,NF,And not come back and I admit I am emotionally scared
98666,NF,To let anyone inside so I just leave my doors locked
98667,NF,You might get other doors to open up but this doors not

98673,NF,I chose this I am lost in my own conscience
98674,NF,I know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
98675,NF,But I didnt build this house because I thought it would solve em
98676,NF,I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
98677,NF,But its not Im not the only thing thats livin in here
98678,NF,Fear came to my house years ago I let him in
98679,NF,Maybe thats the problem cause Ive been dealing with this ever since
98680,NF,I thought that he would leave but its obvious he never did
98681,NF,He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
98682,NF,Now Im in a position its either sit here and let em win
98683,NF,Or put him back outside where he came from but I never can
98684,NF,Cause in order to do that Id have to open the doors

99741,NF,Thats why they come to my shows wearing the NF hoodies and hats low like were carrying weapons ah 
99742,NF,Put the controllers away its game over
99743,NF,The fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
99744,NF,Well thats pretty convenient cause I just made a plate for em
99745,NF,And I dont hear what none of yall are saying
99746,NF,I just sit at the keys feeling the music

99753,NF,If I do am I repeating my actions 
99754,NF,Yeah look  How Could You Leave Us is massive
99755,NF,There aint nothing I can write thatll match that
99756,NF,My biggest fear writing this record wasnt putting out trash
99757,NF,It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
99758,NF,Now I want you to picture me 
99759,NF,Im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
99760,NF,Staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing  How Could You Leave Us through the speakers on my iPhone
99761,NF,Tryna figure out if Ima always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
99762,NF,Or maybe I cant be cause if the music aint emotional enough are they gon call me a has been 
99763,NF,Pains always been the root of my music
99764,NF,If I cut it off how am I supposed to keep growing
99765,NF,If I let it go wont my whole career be in ruins 
99766,NF,Thats when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
99767,NF,I never cared to impress people that dont even know me
99768,NF,I just write what I feel somehow it started a movement
99769,NF,Trying to enjoy a career but I dont know how to do it
99770,NF,When I spend all of my time being afraid Ima lose it 
99771,NF,But then I figured out the reason they follow me
99772,NF,The reason why these fans surrounding me
99773,NF,Its not cause Im a  Rap God 
99774,NF,I dont need you people to bow to me
99775,NF,All they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
99776,NF,Acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
99777,NF,Im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
99778,NF,This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than Halloween 
99779,NF,Yeah you aint alone out there look around you we got a lot of fans in here
99780,NF,Couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year
99781,NF,Listen to Intro III trying to kill my fear
99782,NF,Theyll get that in a minute
99783,NF,We about to shatter the critics
99784,NF,A lot of baggage I live in
99785,NF,Thats why the passion is different
99786,NF,Really dont care if they get it
99787,NF,Were only three records in it and this is just the beginning
99788,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99789,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99790,NF,If youd open your eyes then maybe youd see whats at stake
99791,NF,Youre sleeping youre sleeping
99792,NF,You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
99793,NF,And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
99794,NF,But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
99795,NF,So what you do then is you start going backwards
99796,NF,And you lookin for something that isnt real
99797,NF,And all you know is that you just gotta have it
99798,NF,What youre doin is sleepin
99799,NF,And thinking that youre awake and youre not
99800,NF,And the problem is that you dont know what youre after
99801,NF,So you put everything that you have into what you do
99802,NF,Hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
99803,NF,But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
99804,NF,Then you look back and you start to regret things
99805,NF,And every time you lookin at yours
99806,NF,You feel like everything you have is a waste 
99807,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
99808,NF,Is because you were never awake
99809,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99810,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99811,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99812,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99813,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99814,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99815,NF,You wake up in the morning
99816,NF,But you feel like you never got up and go to work
99817,NF,And you feelin like you aint got a purpose
99818,NF,And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
99819,NF,Like you aint nothing but worthless
99820,NF,A lot of these other people you lookin at
99821,NF,To you you describe as perfect
99822,NF,So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
99823,NF,And fix ya life up cause nothin is workin 
99824,NF,And you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
99825,NF,But really you feel like everything is crashin around you
99826,NF,And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
99827,NF,Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you 
99828,NF,But every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
99829,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
99830,NF,Is because you were never awake 
99831,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99832,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99833,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99834,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99835,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99836,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99837,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99838,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99839,NF,Only time you ever call me is when you feelin like dont nobody else wanna listen
99840,NF,When s the last time you saw me
99841,NF,You probably don t remember that  cause that was back then you were different
99842,NF,I don t wanna hear the sorry s

99844,NF,Yeah you pass me in the hallway
99845,NF,But you ain t say a word to me
99846,NF,Lately all I ever feel is distant
99847,NF,You don t care that you lost me
99848,NF,Had a picture of you sittin on the dash in the car with me
99849,NF,Now it s in my closet with the other ones sittin in a box

99866,NF,Who I m lookin at right now but I know the person that I m lookin at is not you
99867,NF,They say that you are who you hang with
99868,NF,Maybe that s the reason you been changin 
99869,NF,Maybe that s the reason why I m feelin like you re dangerous
99870,NF,And every time we talk it s like I m talkin to a stranger
99871,NF,I just wanna know oh oh oh oh
