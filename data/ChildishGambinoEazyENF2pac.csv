17576,Childish Gambino,This is on a bus back from camp
17577,Childish Gambino,I m thirteen and so are you
17578,Childish Gambino,Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
17579,Childish Gambino,I hadn t met yet running around all summer getting into trouble
17580,Childish Gambino,It turned out it would be me and just one girl That s you
17581,Childish Gambino,And we re still at camp as long as we re on the bus
17582,Childish Gambino,And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
17583,Childish Gambino,We re still wearing our orange camp t shirts We still smell like pineneedles
17584,Childish Gambino,I like you and you like me and I more than like you
17585,Childish Gambino,But I don t know if you do or don t more than like me
17586,Childish Gambino,You ve never said so I haven t been saying anything all summer
17587,Childish Gambino,Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
17588,Childish Gambino,And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
17589,Childish Gambino,A girl who s smart and funny and who if I say something dumb for a laugh
17590,Childish Gambino,Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
17591,Childish Gambino,But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
17592,Childish Gambino,A girl who reads books that no one s assigned to her
17593,Childish Gambino,Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
17594,Childish Gambino,From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
17595,Childish Gambino,Back in the real world we don t go to the same school
17596,Childish Gambino,And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
17597,Childish Gambino,We won t go to the same high school
17598,Childish Gambino,So this is kind of it for us Unless I say something
17599,Childish Gambino,And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
17600,Childish Gambino,The sun s gone down and the bus is quiet A lot of kids are asleep
17601,Childish Gambino,We re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
17602,Childish Gambino,That looks like a kid we know
17603,Childish Gambino,And then I m like  Can I tell you something  
17604,Childish Gambino,And all of a sudden I m telling you
17605,Childish Gambino,And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
17606,Childish Gambino,And your face is there and gone and there and gone
17607,Childish Gambino,As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
17608,Childish Gambino,And there s no expression on it
17609,Childish Gambino,And I think just after a point I m just talking to lengthen the time
17610,Childish Gambino,Where we live in a world where you haven t said  yes or  no yet
17611,Childish Gambino,And regrettably I end up using the word  destiny 
17612,Childish Gambino,I don t remember in what context Doesn t really matter
17613,Childish Gambino,Before long I m out of stuff to say and you smile and say  okay 
17614,Childish Gambino,I don t know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive
17615,Childish Gambino,And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
17616,Childish Gambino,But there s nowhere to go because we re on a bus
17617,Childish Gambino,So I pretend like I m asleep and before long I really am
17618,Childish Gambino,I wake up the bus isn t moving anymore
17619,Childish Gambino,The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
17620,Childish Gambino,I turn and you re not there
17621,Childish Gambino,Then again a lot of kids aren t in their seats anymore
17622,Childish Gambino,We re parked at the pick up point which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
17623,Childish Gambino,The bus is half empty You might be in your dad s car by now
17624,Childish Gambino,Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
17625,Childish Gambino,The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
17626,Childish Gambino,Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
17627,Childish Gambino,Just as one of them reaches my row
17628,Childish Gambino,It used to be our row on our way off
17629,Childish Gambino,It s Michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
17630,Childish Gambino,After throwing rocks at my head
17631,Childish Gambino,Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body wise
17632,Childish Gambino,She stops and looks down at me
17633,Childish Gambino,And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so I can t really see her face
17634,Childish Gambino,But I can see her smile And she says one word  destiny 
17635,Childish Gambino,Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
17636,Childish Gambino,And then she turns and leads them off the bus
17637,Childish Gambino,I didn t know you were friends with them
17638,Childish Gambino,I find my dad in the parking lot He drives me back to our house and camp is over
17639,Childish Gambino,So is summer even though there s two weeks until school starts
17640,Childish Gambino,This isn t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
17641,Childish Gambino,This is a story about how I learned something and I m not saying this thing is true or not
17642,Childish Gambino,I m just saying it s what I learned
17643,Childish Gambino,I told you something It was just for you and you told everybody
17644,Childish Gambino,So I learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always
17645,Childish Gambino,Everybody can t turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows I told them
17646,Childish Gambino,But this means there isn t a place in my life for you or someone like you
17647,Childish Gambino,Is it sad Sure But it s a sadness I chose
17648,Childish Gambino,I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
17649,Childish Gambino,And got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit
17650,Childish Gambino,But that s not true The truth is I got on the bus a boy And I never got off the bus

19792,Childish Gambino,A group of people are dancing around speakers Assumingly music is playing but the events of that scene are muted and replaced by the dialogue of   
19793,Childish Gambino,DONALD and FLYING LOTUS are exchanging verses theyve written
19794,Childish Gambino,Investing time on writing lies slightly truth without a clue
19795,Childish Gambino,I met my higher self pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs

19831,Childish Gambino,DONALD examines his nose in the mirror surprised by the bleeding
19832,Childish Gambino,He looks for the source of all the blood and notices and obstruction in his nasal passage its a string
19833,Childish Gambino,Nauseated and scared he pulls the long blood soaked string while gagging and coughing Finally he dislodges the string and what is attached at the end a golden tooth
19834,Childish Gambino,He places it next to the sink and washes his hands as the sound of the running water transitions into a similar sound of the shower water as DONALD now sits in the shower
19835,Childish Gambino,He is still and his back is to us
19836,Childish Gambino,DONALD and FAM are sitting next to a bonfire eating smores and swapping childhood stories
19837,Childish Gambino,I remember being seventeen being scared as hell Getting prank calls like crazy stuff Just like senior year in high school Had a lot of girls its crazy So this one girl she was super crazy she would call my phone from a blocked number and it was her But then I started getting like the crazy death threats Started as a joke then they knew exactly what kind of car I was driving where I liked to hang out Then they started shooting in the area so I couldnt sleep at home anymore Went and got a gun from my friend Started sleeping on the street for a week The scariest thing about it all though is having a gun knowing you might have to use it scarier than than killing somebody is thinking about killing somebody Sometimes you cant explain why things happen Those seven days man just couldnt handle it Just couldnt handle it You just get to that point like why did I get here Sometimes they just do
19838,Childish Gambino,When I was like five or six we were living in Decatur in the projects On Commerce Drive Its nice now but like we were living there and I remember my moms friend Like a friend of the family This kid like   Something happened I didnt understand it but he had to stay with us for a couple of day I didnt really understand it But we didnt have any space So he had to sleep in my bed I remember in the morning waking up and he was like  Lets rub butts  I was like  okay like whatever I did it And I didnt really get it And then I turned when we turned he kissed me

19846,Childish Gambino,He is flying face up eyes closed The phone rings and he opens his eyes
19847,Childish Gambino,He leans over and picks up the phone

98603,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98604,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98605,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98606,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98607,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion
98608,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
98609,NF,Theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
98610,NF,Written all over the floors all over the chairs
98611,NF,And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
98612,NF,Thats where I write when Im in a bad place and need to release
98613,NF,And let out the version of NF you dont wanna see
98614,NF,I put holes in the walls with both of my fists til they bleed
98615,NF,You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
98616,NF,Physically abused now thats the room that I dont wanna be in
98617,NF,That picture aint blurry at all I just dont wanna see it
98618,NF,And these walls aint blank I just think I dont wanna see em
98619,NF,But why not Im in here so I might as well read em
98620,NF,I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
98621,NF,Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
98622,NF,Matter of fact I think Ima burn this room right now
98623,NF,Somehow this memory for some reason just wont come down
98624,NF,You used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
98625,NF,Then took me downstairs and beat me til I screamed and I cried
98626,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98627,NF,But Ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
98628,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98629,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98630,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98631,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98632,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98633,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98634,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98635,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
98636,NF,See my problem is I dont fix things I just try to repaint
98637,NF,Cover em up like it never happened say  I wish I could change 
98638,NF,Are you confused Come upstairs and Ill show you what I mean
98639,NF,This rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
98640,NF,The moment I walk into its the same moment that I wanna leave
98641,NF,I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
98642,NF,But its hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
98643,NF,I look around one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
98644,NF,Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
98645,NF,One of the first things I wrote was  I wish I woulda called 
98646,NF,But I should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
98647,NF,And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
98648,NF,And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
98649,NF,Shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
98650,NF,Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
98651,NF,And I regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
98652,NF,And at the rate Im goin theyll probably still be there when I die
98653,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98654,NF,The question is will I ever clean the walls off in time 
98655,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98656,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98657,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98658,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98659,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98660,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98661,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98662,NF,So this part of my house no ones been in it for years
98663,NF,I built a safe room and I dont let no one in there
98664,NF,Cause if I do theres a chance that they might disappear
98665,NF,And not come back and I admit I am emotionally scared
98666,NF,To let anyone inside so I just leave my doors locked
98667,NF,You might get other doors to open up but this doors not

98673,NF,I chose this I am lost in my own conscience
98674,NF,I know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
98675,NF,But I didnt build this house because I thought it would solve em
98676,NF,I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
98677,NF,But its not Im not the only thing thats livin in here

98681,NF,He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
98682,NF,Now Im in a position its either sit here and let em win
98683,NF,Or put him back outside where he came from but I never can
98684,NF,Cause in order to do that Id have to open the doors

99743,NF,The fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
99744,NF,Well thats pretty convenient cause I just made a plate for em

99754,NF,Yeah look  How Could You Leave Us is massive
99755,NF,There aint nothing I can write thatll match that
99756,NF,My biggest fear writing this record wasnt putting out trash
99757,NF,It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
99758,NF,Now I want you to picture me 
99759,NF,Im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
99760,NF,Staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing  How Could You Leave Us through the speakers on my iPhone
99761,NF,Tryna figure out if Ima always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
99762,NF,Or maybe I cant be cause if the music aint emotional enough are they gon call me a has been 
99763,NF,Pains always been the root of my music
99764,NF,If I cut it off how am I supposed to keep growing
99765,NF,If I let it go wont my whole career be in ruins 
99766,NF,Thats when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
99767,NF,I never cared to impress people that dont even know me
99768,NF,I just write what I feel somehow it started a movement
99769,NF,Trying to enjoy a career but I dont know how to do it
99770,NF,When I spend all of my time being afraid Ima lose it 
99771,NF,But then I figured out the reason they follow me
99772,NF,The reason why these fans surrounding me
99773,NF,Its not cause Im a  Rap God 
99774,NF,I dont need you people to bow to me
99775,NF,All they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
99776,NF,Acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
99777,NF,Im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
99778,NF,This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than Halloween 
99779,NF,Yeah you aint alone out there look around you we got a lot of fans in here
99780,NF,Couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year
99781,NF,Listen to Intro III trying to kill my fear
99782,NF,Theyll get that in a minute
99783,NF,We about to shatter the critics
99784,NF,A lot of baggage I live in
99785,NF,Thats why the passion is different
99786,NF,Really dont care if they get it
99787,NF,Were only three records in it and this is just the beginning
99788,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99789,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99790,NF,If youd open your eyes then maybe youd see whats at stake
99791,NF,Youre sleeping youre sleeping
99792,NF,You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
99793,NF,And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
99794,NF,But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
99795,NF,So what you do then is you start going backwards
99796,NF,And you lookin for something that isnt real
99797,NF,And all you know is that you just gotta have it
99798,NF,What youre doin is sleepin
99799,NF,And thinking that youre awake and youre not
99800,NF,And the problem is that you dont know what youre after
99801,NF,So you put everything that you have into what you do
99802,NF,Hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
99803,NF,But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
99804,NF,Then you look back and you start to regret things
99805,NF,And every time you lookin at yours
99806,NF,You feel like everything you have is a waste 
99807,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
99808,NF,Is because you were never awake
99809,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99810,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99811,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99812,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99813,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99814,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99815,NF,You wake up in the morning
99816,NF,But you feel like you never got up and go to work
99817,NF,And you feelin like you aint got a purpose
99818,NF,And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
99819,NF,Like you aint nothing but worthless
99820,NF,A lot of these other people you lookin at
99821,NF,To you you describe as perfect
99822,NF,So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
99823,NF,And fix ya life up cause nothin is workin 
99824,NF,And you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
99825,NF,But really you feel like everything is crashin around you
99826,NF,And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
99827,NF,Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you 
99828,NF,But every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
99829,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
99830,NF,Is because you were never awake 
99831,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99832,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99833,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99834,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99835,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99836,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99837,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99838,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99839,NF,Only time you ever call me is when you feelin like dont nobody else wanna listen
99840,NF,When s the last time you saw me
99841,NF,You probably don t remember that  cause that was back then you were different
99842,NF,I don t wanna hear the sorry s

99844,NF,Yeah you pass me in the hallway
99845,NF,But you ain t say a word to me
99846,NF,Lately all I ever feel is distant
99847,NF,You don t care that you lost me

99849,NF,Now it s in my closet with the other ones sittin in a box

99866,NF,Who I m lookin at right now but I know the person that I m lookin at is not you
99867,NF,They say that you are who you hang with
99868,NF,Maybe that s the reason you been changin 
99869,NF,Maybe that s the reason why I m feelin like you re dangerous

99871,NF,I just wanna know oh oh oh oh

125045,2pac, did you hear  did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete provin natures laws wrong it learned to walk without having feet funny it seems but by keeping its dreams it learned to breathe fresh air long live the rose that grew from concrete when no one else even cared 
125046,2pac, keepin all these dreams provin natures laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet  to breathe the fresh air it came from concrete  to breathe the fresh air  to breathe the fresh air to breathe the fresh air
