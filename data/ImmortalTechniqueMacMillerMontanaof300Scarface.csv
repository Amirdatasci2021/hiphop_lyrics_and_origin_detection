48020,Immortal Technique,I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
48021,Immortal Technique,His primary concern was makin a million
48022,Immortal Technique,Bein the illest hustler that the world ever seen
48023,Immortal Technique,He used to fuck movie stars and sniff coke in his dreams
48024,Immortal Technique,A corrupted young mind at the age of thirteen
48025,Immortal Technique,Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
48026,Immortal Technique,She put the pipe down but for every year she was sober
48027,Immortal Technique,Her sons heart simultaneously grew colder
48028,Immortal Technique,He started hangin out sellin bags in the projects
48029,Immortal Technique,Checkin the young chicks lookin for hit and run prospects
48030,Immortal Technique,He was fascinated by material objects
48031,Immortal Technique,But he understood money never bought respect
48032,Immortal Technique,He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
48033,Immortal Technique,But got locked once and didnt hesitate to squeal
48034,Immortal Technique,So criminals he chilled with didnt think he was real
48035,Immortal Technique,You see me and niggas like this have never been equal
48036,Immortal Technique,I dont project my insecurities in other people
48037,Immortal Technique,He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
48038,Immortal Technique,So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
48039,Immortal Technique,A feeble minded young man with infinite potential
48040,Immortal Technique,The product of a ghetto bred capitalistic mental
48041,Immortal Technique,Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
48042,Immortal Technique,Dancin with the Devil smoked until his eyes would bleed
48043,Immortal Technique,But he was sick of sellin trees and gave in to his greed
48044,Immortal Technique,Everyone tryin to be trife never face the consequences
48045,Immortal Technique,You probably only did a month for minor offenses
48046,Immortal Technique,Ask a nigga doin life if he had another chance
48047,Immortal Technique,But then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance
48048,Immortal Technique,Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
48049,Immortal Technique,But thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock
48050,Immortal Technique,Devils used to be Gods angels that fell from the top
48051,Immortal Technique,Theres no diversity because were burnin in the melting pot
48052,Immortal Technique,So Billy started robbin niggas anything he could do
48053,Immortal Technique,To get his respect back in the eyes of his crew
48054,Immortal Technique,Startin fights over little shit up on the block
48055,Immortal Technique,Stepped up to sellin mothers and brothers the crack rock
48056,Immortal Technique,Workin overtime for makin money for the crack spot
48057,Immortal Technique,Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
48058,Immortal Technique,Fulfillin the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
48059,Immortal Technique,Tired of the block niggas treatin him the same
48060,Immortal Technique,He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
48061,Immortal Technique,But when he tried to step to em niggas showed him no love
48062,Immortal Technique,They told him any motherfuckin coward can sell drugs
48063,Immortal Technique,Any bitch nigga with a gun can bust slugs
48064,Immortal Technique,Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
48065,Immortal Technique,Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
48066,Immortal Technique,But only a real thug can stab someone til they die
48067,Immortal Technique,Standin in front of them starin straight into their eyes
48068,Immortal Technique,Billy realized that these men were well guarded
48069,Immortal Technique,And they wanted to test him before business started
48070,Immortal Technique,Suggested rapin a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
48071,Immortal Technique,So now he had a choice between goin back to his life
48072,Immortal Technique,Or makin money with made men up in the cyph
48073,Immortal Technique,His dreams about cars and ice made him agree
48074,Immortal Technique,A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
48075,Immortal Technique,And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
48076,Immortal Technique,Everyone tryin to be trife never face the consequences
48077,Immortal Technique,You probably only did a month for minor offenses
48078,Immortal Technique,Ask a nigga doin life if he had another chance
48079,Immortal Technique,But then again theres always the wicked that knew in advance
48080,Immortal Technique,Dance forever with the Devil on a cold cell block
48081,Immortal Technique,But thats what happens when you rape murder and sell rock
48082,Immortal Technique,Devils used to be Gods angels that fell from the top
48083,Immortal Technique,Theres no diversity because were burnin in the melting pot
48084,Immortal Technique,They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin
48085,Immortal Technique,Smokin blunts drinkin and jokin for entertainment
48086,Immortal Technique,Until they saw a woman on the street walkin alone
48087,Immortal Technique,Three in the mornin comin back from work on her way home
48088,Immortal Technique,And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
48089,Immortal Technique,Walkin through the projects the darkness swallowed her
48090,Immortal Technique,They wrapped her shirt around her head
48091,Immortal Technique,And knocked her onto the floor
48092,Immortal Technique, This is it kid now you got your chance to be raw  
48093,Immortal Technique,So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
48094,Immortal Technique,And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
48095,Immortal Technique,She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
48096,Immortal Technique,They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
48097,Immortal Technique,Screamin  Shut the fuck up and stop movin around  
48098,Immortal Technique,The shirt covered her face but she screamed and clawed
48099,Immortal Technique,So Billy stomped on the bitch until hed broken her jaw
48100,Immortal Technique,The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin
48101,Immortal Technique,They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin
48102,Immortal Technique,Blood leakin through the cloth she cried silently
48103,Immortal Technique,And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
48104,Immortal Technique,Billy was made to go first but each of them took a turn
48105,Immortal Technique,Rippin her up and chokin her until her throat burned
48106,Immortal Technique,Her broken jaw mumbled for God but they werent concerned
48107,Immortal Technique,When they were done and she was lyin
48108,Immortal Technique,One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty two
48109,Immortal Technique,They told him that she was a witness of what shed gone through
48110,Immortal Technique,And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
48111,Immortal Technique,He thought about it for a minute she was practically dead
48112,Immortal Technique,And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
48113,Immortal Technique,Im fallin and I cant turn back
48114,Immortal Technique,Im fallin and I cant turn back
48115,Immortal Technique,Right before he pulled the trigger and ended her life
48116,Immortal Technique,He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
48117,Immortal Technique,And he felt strong standin along with his new brothers
48118,Immortal Technique,Cocked the gat to her head and pulled back the shirt cover
48119,Immortal Technique,But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
48120,Immortal Technique,Cause he was starin into the eyes of his own mother
48121,Immortal Technique,She looked back at him and cried cause he had forsaken her
48122,Immortal Technique,She cried more painfully than when they were rapin her
48123,Immortal Technique,His whole world stopped he couldnt even contemplate
48124,Immortal Technique,His corruption had successfully changed his fate
48125,Immortal Technique,And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
48126,Immortal Technique,Workin hard for nothin because now what was he worth 
48127,Immortal Technique,He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
48128,Immortal Technique,And cryin out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
48129,Immortal Technique,But only the Devil responded cause God wasnt there
48130,Immortal Technique,And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
48131,Immortal Technique,And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
48132,Immortal Technique,They say death takes you to a better place but I doubt it
48133,Immortal Technique,After that they killed his mother and never spoke about it
48134,Immortal Technique,And listen cause the story that Im tellin is true
48135,Immortal Technique,Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
48136,Immortal Technique,And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
48137,Immortal Technique,In fact Im sure hes standin among one of you at my shows
48138,Immortal Technique,And every street cypher listenin to little thugs flow
48139,Immortal Technique,He could be standin right next to you and you wouldnt know
48140,Immortal Technique,The Devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
48141,Immortal Technique,White brown yellow and black  color is not restricted
48142,Immortal Technique,You have a self destructive destiny when youre inflicted
48143,Immortal Technique,And youll be one of Gods children that fell from the top
48144,Immortal Technique,Theres no diversity because were burnin in the melting pot
48145,Immortal Technique,So when the Devil wants to dance with you you better say never
48146,Immortal Technique,Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever
48147,Immortal Technique,Oh yall motherfuckers thought it was over huh 
48148,Immortal Technique,Well it s not you didn t count on a fallen angel gettin back

48184,Immortal Technique,And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
48185,Immortal Technique,This puppet democracy brain washed your psychology
48186,Immortal Technique,So you re nothin like diversity without equality
48187,Immortal Technique,And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
48188,Immortal Technique,Usin numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
48189,Immortal Technique,Produces more digits than   divided by  
48190,Immortal Technique,You re like Kevin Spacey your style is usually suspect
48191,Immortal Technique,You never killed a cop you not a motherfuckin thug yet
48192,Immortal Technique,Your mind is empty and spacious
48193,Immortal Technique,Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
48194,Immortal Technique,Face it you re too basic you re never gonna make it
48195,Immortal Technique,Like children walkin through Antarctica butt naked
48196,Immortal Technique,She was on her way to becomin a college graduate
48197,Immortal Technique,Wouldnt even stop to talk to the average kid
48198,Immortal Technique,The type of Latina Id sit and contemplate marriage with
48199,Immortal Technique,Fuck the horse and carriage shit her love was never for hire
48200,Immortal Technique,Disciplined intellectual beauty is what I desire
48201,Immortal Technique,Flyer than Salma Hayek or Jennifer Lopez
48202,Immortal Technique,Everyone told me kickin it to her was hopeless
48203,Immortal Technique,At first I just thought she didnt mess with broke kids
48204,Immortal Technique,The thug niggas always talkin about how they smoke kids
48205,Immortal Technique,But the rich sniff coke kids got no play
48206,Immortal Technique, Im not even interested is what her body language would say
48207,Immortal Technique,Everyone around the way gave up tryin to get in it
48208,Immortal Technique,It didnt matter how good your game was she wasnt with it
48209,Immortal Technique,On the block bitches was jealous but wouldnt admit it
48210,Immortal Technique,Talk shit and deny to everyone that they did it  cause they regretted the long list of niggas that they let hit it
48211,Immortal Technique,And no one ever gave them shit except McDonalds and did dick
48212,Immortal Technique,Smokin weed with thoughts of envy whenever they lit it
48213,Immortal Technique,She spoke intelligently and they bit it always tryin to copy
48214,Immortal Technique,But when they tried to use her vocab they sounded sloppy
48215,Immortal Technique,She had a style all her own respectful and pure
48216,Immortal Technique,I was sick in the head for her and there wasnt a cure
48217,Immortal Technique,Dont you know that time waits for no man 
48218,Immortal Technique,Im blessed just to know you
48219,Immortal Technique,Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
48220,Immortal Technique,God came between you and I
48221,Immortal Technique,If I had the chance again Id never let you go
48222,Immortal Technique,Hold tight to your love  cause you never know
48223,Immortal Technique,Her eyes are brown and beautiful yet empty and sad
48224,Immortal Technique,I used to talk to her occasionally and she was glad
48225,Immortal Technique,That I wasnt just another nigga tryin to get in it
48226,Immortal Technique,So every now and then wed stop and talk for a minute
48227,Immortal Technique,I didnt have a gimmick so the minutes turned to hours
48228,Immortal Technique,On her birthday I gave her a poem with flowers
48229,Immortal Technique,Then I took her out to dinner after her cousins baby shower
48230,Immortal Technique,We talked about power to the people and such
48231,Immortal Technique,We spent more time together but it was never enough
48232,Immortal Technique,I never tried to sneak a touch or even cop a feel
48233,Immortal Technique,I was too interested in keepin it real
48234,Immortal Technique,Perfectly honest and complete
48235,Immortal Technique,She would always call me  cari o and never Technique
48236,Immortal Technique,Bought me a new book to read every two or three weeks
48237,Immortal Technique,Forever changin the expression of my thoughts when I speak
48238,Immortal Technique,It was because of her I even deaded all of my freaks
48239,Immortal Technique,She convinced me to stop hangin out on the streets
48240,Immortal Technique,To stop robbin and stealin from people like you
48241,Immortal Technique,Instead I took her out to the Apollo and the Bronx Zoo
48242,Immortal Technique,Museo del Barrio and the Metropolitan too
48243,Immortal Technique,Got to the point when I was either with her or my crew
48244,Immortal Technique,So I decided one day to tell her my feelings was true
48245,Immortal Technique,I couldnt live without her so I told her facin my fears
48246,Immortal Technique,But honeys only response was a face full of tears
48247,Immortal Technique,She could only sob hysterically holdin me tight
48248,Immortal Technique,I tried to speak but she wouldnt stop until I left sight
48249,Immortal Technique,I felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light
48250,Immortal Technique,Except I didnt burn I turned cold after that night
48251,Immortal Technique,Dont you know that time waits for no man 
48252,Immortal Technique,Im blessed just to know you
48253,Immortal Technique,Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
48254,Immortal Technique,God came between you and I
48255,Immortal Technique,If I had the chance again Id never let you go
48256,Immortal Technique,Hold tight to your love  cause you never know
48257,Immortal Technique,I went on with my life college and my career
48258,Immortal Technique,Ended up locked up like an animal for a year
48259,Immortal Technique,Where the C O s talk to you like they were the overseer
48260,Immortal Technique,Then I got sent to the hole when my exit was near
48261,Immortal Technique,At night in my cell Id close my eyes and Id see her
48262,Immortal Technique,Hold her close in my dreams but when I woke she disappeared
48263,Immortal Technique,Just an empty cell until the state gave me parole
48264,Immortal Technique,In the summer came back intact and on track
48265,Immortal Technique,But the fact of the matter is I still felt cold
48266,Immortal Technique,Even after my mother hugged me cryin at home
48267,Immortal Technique,My real niggas would catch me thinkin outta my zone
48268,Immortal Technique,Fuckin lots of different women but I still felt alone
48269,Immortal Technique,Relatively well known around the New York underground
48270,Immortal Technique,But I kept thinkin of her and how we used to be down
48271,Immortal Technique,The sound of her voice and the beautiful smell of her hair
48272,Immortal Technique,Though gone physically somehow it was still there
48273,Immortal Technique,I had to do somethin because the shit was too much to bear
48274,Immortal Technique,So I went and visited the building where she used to live
48275,Immortal Technique,The world looks a lot different after you do a bid
48276,Immortal Technique,The way your life done changed
48277,Immortal Technique,While primitive minds are still stuck in the same game
48278,Immortal Technique,Like her cousin who was on the corner slangin cocaine
48279,Immortal Technique,Stepped in the lobby and tapped the button next to her last name
48280,Immortal Technique,Her mom buzzed me up and hugged me up like a mother oughta
48281,Immortal Technique,But her facial expression changed
48282,Immortal Technique,When I asked about her daughter
48283,Immortal Technique,Dont you know that time waits for no man 
48284,Immortal Technique,Im blessed just to know you
48285,Immortal Technique,Ive loved and Ive lost just to hold you all night
48286,Immortal Technique,God came between you and I
48287,Immortal Technique,If I had the chance again Id never let you go
48288,Immortal Technique,Hold tight to your love  cause you never know
48289,Immortal Technique,She told me that there was a note for me that was left behind
48290,Immortal Technique,And she had left it there waitin for such a long time
48291,Immortal Technique,I was inclined to ask about it but she brought it up first
48292,Immortal Technique,I saw a tear swellin up in her eye and then she cursed
48293,Immortal Technique,She told me where the letter was and I started thinkin the worst
48294,Immortal Technique,Reversed my position stepped over and opened the door
48295,Immortal Technique,And sure enough there was an envelope
48296,Immortal Technique,With my name on the floor  Nobody loves you more than me cari o  is what the letter said
48297,Immortal Technique, By the time you get to read this Ill probably be dead
48298,Immortal Technique,But when you left in    a part of me went to Heaven
48299,Immortal Technique,I thank God at least I got to know what love really was
48300,Immortal Technique,But it hurt me to see what true love really does
48301,Immortal Technique, Cause even though we never made love
48302,Immortal Technique,You were all that there was
48303,Immortal Technique,It was because I loved you so much that I had to make you leave
48304,Immortal Technique,You made me doubt the way I thought
48305,Immortal Technique,You made me want to believe
48306,Immortal Technique,And then I slipped up and I let you get close to me
48307,Immortal Technique,It was hard to not be openly when people spoke to me
48308,Immortal Technique,This was not the way I thought my life was supposed to be
48309,Immortal Technique,I had a blood transfusion that left me with HIV
48310,Immortal Technique,Hope didnt exist for me since late in     
48311,Immortal Technique,I died a virgin I wish I couldve given myself to you
48312,Immortal Technique,I cried in the hospital because there was no one else but you
48313,Immortal Technique,Promise that youll meet me in Paradise inevitably
48314,Immortal Technique,No matter what Ill keep your love forever with me  
48315,Immortal Technique,What happened for the rest of the day is still a blur
48316,Immortal Technique,But I remember wishin that I was dead instead of her
48317,Immortal Technique,She was buried on August  rd
48318,Immortal Technique,The story ends without a sequel and now you know why Technique dont fuckin fall in love with people
48319,Immortal Technique,Hold the person that you love closely if theyre next to you
48320,Immortal Technique,The one you love not the person thatll simply have sex with you
48321,Immortal Technique,Appreciate them to the fullest extent and then beyond
48322,Immortal Technique, Cause you never really know what you got until its gone

48395,Immortal Technique,Livin the struggle I know Im alive when I bleed

48486,Immortal Technique,I doubt that there could ever be a more wicked MC
48487,Immortal Technique,Cause AIDS infested child molesters arent sicker than me
48488,Immortal Technique,I see the world for what it is beyond the white and the black
48489,Immortal Technique,The way the government downplays historical facts
48490,Immortal Technique,Cause the United States sponsored the rise of the Third Reich
48491,Immortal Technique,Just like the CIA trained terrorists how to fight
48492,Immortal Technique,Build bombs and sneak box cutters onto a flight
48493,Immortal Technique,When I was a child the Devil himself bought me a mic
48494,Immortal Technique,But I refused the offer cause God sent me to strike
48495,Immortal Technique,With skills unused like fallopian tubes on a dyke
48496,Immortal Technique,My wordsll expose George Bush and Bin Laden
48497,Immortal Technique,As two separate parts of the same seven headed dragon
48498,Immortal Technique,And you cant fathom the truth so you dont hear me
48499,Immortal Technique,You think Illuminatis just a fuckin conspiracy theory 
48500,Immortal Technique,Thats why conservative racists are all runnin shit

48506,Immortal Technique,Father forgive them for they dont know right from wrong
48507,Immortal Technique,The truth will set you free written down in this song

48509,Immortal Technique,The Word of God brought to life thatll save your soul
48510,Immortal Technique,Save your soul motherfucker save your soul 
48511,Immortal Technique,I hacked the Pentagon for self incriminating evidence
48512,Immortal Technique,Of Republican manufactured white powder pestilence
48513,Immortal Technique,Marines Corps flak vest with the guns and ammo
48514,Immortal Technique,Spittin bars like a demon stuck inside a piano
48515,Immortal Technique,Turn a Sambo into a soldier with just one line
48516,Immortal Technique,So heres the truth about the system thatll fuck up your mind
48517,Immortal Technique,They gave al Qaeda six billion dollars in     to     
48518,Immortal Technique,And now the last chapters of Revelations are comin true
48519,Immortal Technique,And I know a lot of people find it hard to swallow this
48520,Immortal Technique,Cause subliminal bigotry makes you hate my politics
48521,Immortal Technique,But you act like America wouldnt destroy two buildings
48522,Immortal Technique,In a country that was sponsorin bombs dropped on our children
48523,Immortal Technique,I was watchin the Towers and though I wasnt the closest
48524,Immortal Technique,I saw them crumble to the earth like they were full of explosives
48525,Immortal Technique,And they thought nobody noticed the news report that they did
48526,Immortal Technique,About the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge
48527,Immortal Technique,Four non Arabs arrested during the emergency
48528,Immortal Technique,And then it disappeared from the news permanently
48529,Immortal Technique,They dubbed a tape of Osama and they said it was proof
48530,Immortal Technique,Jealous of our freedom I cant believe you bought that excuse 
48531,Immortal Technique,Rockin a motherfuckin flag dont make you a hero
48532,Immortal Technique,The Devil crept into Heaven God overslept on the seventh
48533,Immortal Technique,The New World Order was born on September eleventh
48534,Immortal Technique,Father forgive them for they dont know right from wrong
48535,Immortal Technique,The truth will set you free written down in this song
48536,Immortal Technique,And the song has the Cause of Death written in code
48537,Immortal Technique,The Word of God brought to life thatll save your soul
48538,Immortal Technique,Save your soul motherfucker save your soul 
48539,Immortal Technique,And just so conservatives dont take it to heart
48540,Immortal Technique,I dont think Bush did it cause he isnt that smart
48541,Immortal Technique,Hes just a stupid puppet takin orders on his cell phone
48542,Immortal Technique,From the same people that sabotaged Senator Wellstone
48543,Immortal Technique,The military industry got it poppin and lockin
48544,Immortal Technique,Lookin for a way to justify the Wolfowitz Doctrine
48545,Immortal Technique,And as a matter of fact Rumsfeld now that I think back
48546,Immortal Technique,Without      you couldnt have a war in Iraq
48547,Immortal Technique,Or a defense budget of world conquest proportions
48548,Immortal Technique,Kill freedom of speech and revoke the right to abortion
48549,Immortal Technique,Tax cut extortion a blessing to the wealthy and wicked
48550,Immortal Technique,But you still have to answer to the Armageddon you scripted
48551,Immortal Technique,And Dick Cheney you fuckin leech tell them your plans
48552,Immortal Technique,About building your pipelines through Afghanistan
48553,Immortal Technique,And how Israeli troops trained the Taliban in Pakistan
48554,Immortal Technique,You might have some house niggas fooled but I understand
48555,Immortal Technique,Colonialism is sponsored by corporations
48556,Immortal Technique,Thats why Halliburton gets paid to rebuild nations
48557,Immortal Technique,Tell me the truth I dont scare into paralysis
48558,Immortal Technique,I know the CIA saw Bin Laden on dialysis
48559,Immortal Technique,In   when he was top ten for the FBI
48560,Immortal Technique,Government ties is really why the government lies
48561,Immortal Technique,Read it yourself instead of askin the government why
48562,Immortal Technique,Cause then the cause of deathll cause the propaganda to die
48563,Immortal Technique,He is scheduled for sixty minutes next He is going on French British Italian Japanese television People everywhere are starting to listen to him its embarrassing 
48564,Immortal Technique,And yet the past refuses to rest in its shallow grave
48565,Immortal Technique,For those who hide behind the false image of the son of man
48566,Immortal Technique,It has begun the beginning of the end
48567,Immortal Technique,The voice of racism preachin the gospel is devilish
48568,Immortal Technique,A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
48569,Immortal Technique,Forgetting God is not a religion but a spiritual bond
48570,Immortal Technique,And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Quran
48571,Immortal Technique,They bombed innocent people tryna murder Saddam
48572,Immortal Technique,When you gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
48573,Immortal Technique,This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
48574,Immortal Technique,Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
48575,Immortal Technique,I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
48576,Immortal Technique,The Judas I hang with the guilt of betraying Christ
48577,Immortal Technique,You murdered and stole his religion and painting him white
48578,Immortal Technique,Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
48579,Immortal Technique,Conservative political right wing ideology
48580,Immortal Technique,Glued together sloppily the blasphemy of a nation
48581,Immortal Technique,Got my back to the wall cause Im facin assassination
48582,Immortal Technique,Guantanamo Bay federal incarceration
48583,Immortal Technique,How could this be the land of the free home of the brave
48584,Immortal Technique,Indigenous holocaust and the home of the slaves
48585,Immortal Technique,Corporate America dancin offbeat to the rhythm
48586,Immortal Technique,You really think this country never sponsored terrorism
48587,Immortal Technique,Human rights violations we continue the saga
48588,Immortal Technique,El Savador and the contras in Nicaragua
48589,Immortal Technique,And on top of that you still wanna take me to prison
48590,Immortal Technique,Just cause I wont trade humanity for patriotism
48591,Immortal Technique,Its like MKUltra controllin your brain
48592,Immortal Technique,Suggestive thinking causing your perspective to change
48593,Immortal Technique,They wanna rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
48594,Immortal Technique,The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
48595,Immortal Technique,A bandanna full of glittering generality
48596,Immortal Technique,Fightin for freedom and fightin terror but whats reality
48597,Immortal Technique,Read about the history of the place that we live in
48598,Immortal Technique,And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children
48599,Immortal Technique,Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
48600,Immortal Technique,Broken apart like a womans heart abused in a marriage
48601,Immortal Technique,The brink of holy war bottled up like a miscarriage
48602,Immortal Technique,Embedded correspondents dont tell the source of the tension
48603,Immortal Technique,And they refuse to even mention European intervention
48604,Immortal Technique,Or the massacres in Jenin the innocent screams
48605,Immortal Technique,U S manufactured missles and M   s
48606,Immortal Technique,Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
48607,Immortal Technique,Media censorship blocking out the video screens
48608,Immortal Technique,A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain
48609,Immortal Technique,Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin
48610,Immortal Technique,The average citizen made to be blind to the reason
48611,Immortal Technique,A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin
48612,Immortal Technique,And the world doesnt believe that you fightin for freedom
48613,Immortal Technique,Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
48614,Immortal Technique,Its open season with the CIA buggin my crib
48615,Immortal Technique,Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
48616,Immortal Technique,Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
48617,Immortal Technique,Im tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life
48618,Immortal Technique,But when Im gone theyll sing a song about Immortal Technique
48619,Immortal Technique,Who beheaded the President and the princes and sheiks
48620,Immortal Technique,You dont give a fuck about us I can see through your facade

48631,Immortal Technique,The fourth branch of the government AKA the media

48633,Immortal Technique,As if their opinion was at all unbiased
48634,Immortal Technique,A machine shouldnt speak for men
48635,Immortal Technique,So shut the fuck up you mindless drone
48636,Immortal Technique,When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
48637,Immortal Technique,To try to convince you theyre fair and balanced
48638,Immortal Technique,When theyre some of the most ignorant and racist people
48639,Immortal Technique,Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
48640,Immortal Technique,We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
48641,Immortal Technique,We die in wars we dont get the contracts to make money off em afterwards

48655,Immortal Technique,Hell is not a place you go if youre not a Christian
48656,Immortal Technique,Its the failure of your lifes greatest ambition
48657,Immortal Technique,Its a bad decision to blindly follow any religion

48817,Immortal Technique,You could call it reparations or restitution
48818,Immortal Technique,Lock and load nigga Industrial revolution
48819,Immortal Technique,Most of my Latino and black people who are struggling to get food clothes and shelter in the hood are so concerned with that that philosophising about freedom and socialist democracy is usually unfortunately beyond their rationale They dont realize that America cant exist without separating them from their identity because if we had some sense of who we really are theres no way in hell wed allow this country to push its genocidal consensus on our homelands This ignorance exists but it can be destroyed
48820,Immortal Technique,Niggas talk about change and working within the system to achieve that The problem with always being a conformist is that when you try to change the system from within its not you who changes the system its the system that will eventually change you There is usually nothing wrong with compromise in a situation but compromising yourself in a situation is another story completely and I have seen this happen long enough in the few years that Ive been alive to know that its a serious problem Latino America is a huge colony of countries whose presidents are cowards in the face of economic imperialism You see third world countries are rich places abundant in resources and many of these countries have the capacity to feed their starving people and the children we always see digging for food in trash on commercials But plutocracies in other words a government run by the rich such as this one and traditionally oppressive European states force the third world into buying overpriced unnecessary goods while exporting huge portions of their natural resources
48821,Immortal Technique,Im quite sure that people will look upon my attitude and sentiments and look for hypocrisy and hatred in my words My revolution is born out of love for my people not hatred for others
48822,Immortal Technique,You see most of Latinos are here because of the great inflation that was caused by American companies in Latin America Aside from that many are seeking a life away from the puppet democracies that were funded by the United States places like El Salvador Guatemala Peru Colombia Nicaragua Ecuador and Republica Dominicana and not just Spanish speaking countries either but Haiti and Jamaica as well
48823,Immortal Technique,As different as we have been taught to look at each other by colonial society we are in the same struggle and until we realize that well be fighting for scraps from the table of a system that has kept us subservient instead of being self determined And thats why we have no control over when the embargo will stop in Cuba or when the bombs will stop dropping in Vieques
48824,Immortal Technique,But you see here in America the attitude that is fed to us is that outside of America there live lesser people  Fuck them let them fend for themselves  No Fuck you they are you No matter how much you want to dye your hair blonde and put fake eyes in or follow an anorexic standard of beauty or no matter how many diamonds you buy from people who exploit your own brutally to get them no matter what kind of car you drive or what kind of fancy clothes you put on you will never be them Theyre always gonna look at you as nothing but a little monkey Id rather be proud of what I am rather than desperately trying to be something Im really not just to fit in And whether we want to accept it or not thats what this culture or lack of culture is feeding us
48825,Immortal Technique,I want a better life for my family and for my children but it doesnt have to be at the expense of millions of lives in my homeland Were given the idea that if we didnt have these people to exploit then America wouldnt be rich enough to let us have these little petty material things in our lives and basic standards of living No thats wrong Its the business giants and the government officials who make all the real money We have whatever they kick down to us My enemy is not the average white man its not the kid down the block or the kids I see on the street my enemy is the white man I dont see the people in the white house the corporate monopoly owners fake liberal politicians those are my enemies The generals of the armies that are mostly conservatives those are the real Mother Fuckers that I need to bring it to not the poor broke country ass soldier thats too stupid to know shit about the way things are set up
48826,Immortal Technique,In fact I have more in common with most working and middle class white people than I do with most rich black and Latino people As much as racism bleeds America we need to understand that classism is the real issue Many of us are in the same boat and its sinking while these bougie Mother Fuckers ride on a luxury liner and as long as we keep fighting over kicking people out of the little boat were all in were gonna miss an opportunity to gain a better standard of living as a whole
48827,Immortal Technique,In other words I dont want to escape the plantation I want to come back free all my people hang the Mother Fucker that kept me there and burn the house to the god damn ground I want to take over the encomienda
48828,Immortal Technique,And give it back to the people who work the land
48829,Immortal Technique,You cannot change the past but you can make the future and anyone who tells you different is a Fucking lethargic devil I dont look at a few token Latinos and black people in the public eye as some type of achievement for my people as a whole Most of those successful individuals are sell outs and house Negros
48830,Immortal Technique,But I dont consider brothers a sell out if they move out of the ghetto Poverty has nothing to do with our people Its not in our culture to be poor Thats only been the last    years of our history look at the last     years of our existence and what we brought to the world in terms of science mathematics agriculture and forms of government You know the idea of a confederation of provinces where one federal government controls the states The Europeans who came to this country stole that idea from the Iroquois league The idea of impeaching a ruler comes from an Aztec tradition Thats why Montezuma was stoned to death by his own people cause he represented the agenda of white Spaniards once he was captured Not the Aztec people who would become Mexicans
48831,Immortal Technique,So in conclusion Im not gonna vote for anybody just cause they Black or Latino They have to truly represent the community
48832,Immortal Technique,And represent whats good for all of us proletariat
48833,Immortal Technique,Porque sino entonces te mando por el carajo cabron gusano hijo de puta seramos libre pronto viva la revolucion VIVA LA REVOLUCION

48859,Immortal Technique,But none of their kids serve in the infantry
48860,Immortal Technique,The odds are stacked against us like a casino

49123,Immortal Technique,The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
49124,Immortal Technique,No matter where you at it always follows you where you are
49125,Immortal Technique,And its hard out there for a pimp to get out of
49126,Immortal Technique,But its harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
49127,Immortal Technique,I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
49128,Immortal Technique,Ironically running from slavery that prison creates
49129,Immortal Technique,So I never hate on the South I respect their vision
49130,Immortal Technique,I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
49131,Immortal Technique,And white execs that love to see us in that position
49132,Immortal Technique,They reflect the stereotypes of Americas vision
49133,Immortal Technique,They want us dancing cooning and hollering

49140,Immortal Technique,This is a struggle to save civilization
49141,Immortal Technique,Demonstrations overthrowing the occupation
49142,Immortal Technique,The annihilation of mental colonization
49143,Immortal Technique,Civil war for the soul of a nation
49144,Immortal Technique,We fight for the future of our civilization

49146,Immortal Technique,Trying to survive cultural assassination
49147,Immortal Technique,Crip niggas Blood niggas eses Asians
49148,Immortal Technique,Why the fuck we warring with each others population 
49149,Immortal Technique,The devil wanna dead all our population
49150,Immortal Technique,People and Folk Nation why the separation 
49151,Immortal Technique,Why we got Jamaicans hating on Hatians
49152,Immortal Technique,When the British and French raped both nations 
49153,Immortal Technique,Mexicans and Blacks kill each other straight hating
49154,Immortal Technique,While the government profits from prison population
49155,Immortal Technique,If you on the bottom be you Anglo or Asian
49156,Immortal Technique,You gotta recognize the realness of what Im saying
49157,Immortal Technique,You gotta recognize another G aint the enemy
49158,Immortal Technique,When the police ride and kill us frequently
49159,Immortal Technique,We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
49160,Immortal Technique,If you a G then grow and develop GD
49161,Immortal Technique,  years of gangs and our people still poor
49162,Immortal Technique,If we really run the streets we should really end war
49163,Immortal Technique,Our hearts were torn apart just like yall was
49164,Immortal Technique,Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
49165,Immortal Technique,Everytime we called your office you ignored us
49166,Immortal Technique,Now you holding hearings on us all inside of Congress
49167,Immortal Technique,Microscopes on us ask if were jihadists
49168,Immortal Technique,My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
49169,Immortal Technique,I think Patrick said it best Give me liberty or death
49170,Immortal Technique,I shall never accept anything less
49171,Immortal Technique,You claim innocence you play victimless
49172,Immortal Technique,But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self defense
49173,Immortal Technique,Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
49174,Immortal Technique,Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
49175,Immortal Technique,We believe in freedom justice security
49176,Immortal Technique,But theyre only pure when theyre applied universally
49177,Immortal Technique,So certainly if I rage against the machine
49178,Immortal Technique,My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
49179,Immortal Technique,Urgently putting fear inside your heart
49180,Immortal Technique,Make you burn Qurans and tell me not to build a mosque
49181,Immortal Technique,Me my wife and babies we aint never made jihad
49182,Immortal Technique,We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
49183,Immortal Technique,Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
49184,Immortal Technique,The greatest threat of harm doesnt come from any bomb
49185,Immortal Technique,The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
49186,Immortal Technique,What happens when that few includes you Civil war
49187,Immortal Technique,They say the odds against me are crooked and impossible
49188,Immortal Technique,Like I was born with a hole in my heart as an obstacle
49189,Immortal Technique,I was left to die by the doctors in the Childrens Hospital
49190,Immortal Technique,But I never lose hope success is psychological
49191,Immortal Technique,The world is volatile and the street is my education
49192,Immortal Technique,Shapin the nation like the blueprint of a Mason
49193,Immortal Technique,While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
49194,Immortal Technique,So Im focused on my economic situation
49195,Immortal Technique,Im like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
49196,Immortal Technique,I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
49197,Immortal Technique,A lot of niggas drop science but they dont know the math
49198,Immortal Technique,Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
49199,Immortal Technique,Its funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
49200,Immortal Technique,But never raise the gun and cry out  Freedom at last  
49201,Immortal Technique,The cold war is over but the world is still gettin colder
49202,Immortal Technique,Atlas walkin through the projects with the hood on my shoulders
49203,Immortal Technique,I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
49204,Immortal Technique,But then a general will decide when their life would be over
49205,Immortal Technique,So I work hard until my personalitys split
49206,Immortal Technique,Like the Black Panthers into the Bloods and the Crips
49207,Immortal Technique,They said I would never be shit but now I sit and reminisce
49208,Immortal Technique,Like Yeshua ben Yusef flippin through Genesis
49209,Immortal Technique,Ignorance is venomous and it murders the soul
49210,Immortal Technique,Spreadin like a virus runnin rampant out of control
49211,Immortal Technique,So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
49212,Immortal Technique,Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
49213,Immortal Technique,From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
49214,Immortal Technique,Spray paintin on the streets and at the subway tunnels
49215,Immortal Technique,Write it down and remember that we never gave in
49216,Immortal Technique,The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
49217,Immortal Technique,So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
49218,Immortal Technique,How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else 
49219,Immortal Technique,Immortal Technique in the streets back on the hustle
49220,Immortal Technique, Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffin cracks in a duffle
49221,Immortal Technique,Upstate behind steel gates attacked in a scuffle
49222,Immortal Technique,Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils
49223,Immortal Technique,Hacked through your muscle
49224,Immortal Technique,But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
49225,Immortal Technique,And its the lawyers not the inmates schemin to fuck you
49226,Immortal Technique,Tryna fight the system from inside eventually corrupts you
49227,Immortal Technique,But thats what you get when you put a corporation above you
49228,Immortal Technique,And its the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
49229,Immortal Technique,Sometimes when they die you find yourself cursin their ghost
49230,Immortal Technique,But you make success nobody delivers your fate
49231,Immortal Technique,Sometimes you give and you take
49232,Immortal Technique,Since prehistoric vertebrates crawled out of the lakes
49233,Immortal Technique,And thats the truth about life
49234,Immortal Technique,Or to do it to ghetto and your car rims and your ice
49235,Immortal Technique,Because even though we survived
49236,Immortal Technique,Through the struggle that made us
49237,Immortal Technique,We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
49238,Immortal Technique,But Im going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
49239,Immortal Technique,And semi automatic barrages that empty the cartridge
49240,Immortal Technique,Post traumatically scarred kids that try to be brave
49241,Immortal Technique,Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
49242,Immortal Technique,Turn cannibal like knights during the crusades
49243,Immortal Technique,Afraid of responsibility addicted to greed
49244,Immortal Technique,Beatin their girl purposefully losin a seed
49245,Immortal Technique,As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive
49246,Immortal Technique,So if I should ever fall and get caught in the hustle
49247,Immortal Technique,Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
49248,Immortal Technique,From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
49249,Immortal Technique,Spray paintin on the streets and at the subway tunnels
49250,Immortal Technique,Write it down and remember that we never gave in
49251,Immortal Technique,The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
49252,Immortal Technique,So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
49253,Immortal Technique,How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else 
49254,Immortal Technique,I used to wonder about people who dont believe in themselves
49255,Immortal Technique,But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
49256,Immortal Technique,They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
49257,Immortal Technique,Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin ourselves
49258,Immortal Technique,I used to wonder about people who dont believe in themselves
49259,Immortal Technique,But then I saw the way they portrayed us to everyone else
49260,Immortal Technique,They cursed us to only see the worst in ourselves
49261,Immortal Technique,Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurtin ourselves
49262,Immortal Technique,Oh you motherfuckers thought it was over huh 
49263,Immortal Technique,Well its not you didnt count on a fallen angel
49264,Immortal Technique,Gettin back into the grace of God and comin after you

49266,Immortal Technique,Yo Diabolic take this motherfuckers head off 
49267,Immortal Technique,Ill snap your trigger finger in six spots
49268,Immortal Technique,Youll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
49269,Immortal Technique,Put away your writtens and holla back
49270,Immortal Technique,Cant freestyle youre screwed off the top like bottle caps
49271,Immortal Technique,Beneath the surface Im overheatin your receivin circuits
49272,Immortal Technique,By unleashin deeper verses than priests speak in churches
49273,Immortal Technique,What you preach is worthless
49274,Immortal Technique,Your worship defeat the purpose
49275,Immortal Technique,Like President Bush takin bullets for the Secret Service
49276,Immortal Technique,I shit on cats and jaw tap em
49277,Immortal Technique,Show no compassion like havin a straight faced orgasm
49278,Immortal Technique,Tour jack him have his half a ten bitch suck my friends dick
49279,Immortal Technique,In the mean time you can French kiss this clenched fist
49280,Immortal Technique,Diabolic a one man brigade spreadin cancer plague
49281,Immortal Technique,Fist fuckin a pussys face holdin a hand grenade
49282,Immortal Technique,So if I catch you bluffin faggot youre less than nothin
49283,Immortal Technique,I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
49284,Immortal Technique,You motherfuckers are nothin you cannot harm me
49285,Immortal Technique,Ill resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
49286,Immortal Technique,Storm the planet huntin you down  cause Im on a mission
49287,Immortal Technique,To split your body into a billion one celled organisms
49288,Immortal Technique,Immortal Techniquell destroy your religion you stupid bitch
49289,Immortal Technique,Youre faker than blue eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
49290,Immortal Technique,Im about to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips
49291,Immortal Technique,Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
49292,Immortal Technique,Im like time itself Im gonna kill you inevitably
49293,Immortal Technique,Chemically bomb you fuck usin a chrome piece 
49294,Immortal Technique,Im Illmatic you wont make it home like Jeromes niece
49295,Immortal Technique,Ill sever your head diagonally for thinkin of dissin me
49296,Immortal Technique,And then use your dead body to write my name in calligraphy
49297,Immortal Technique,This puppet democracy brainwashed your psychology
49298,Immortal Technique,So youre nothin like diversity without equality
49299,Immortal Technique,And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
49300,Immortal Technique,Usin numerology to count the people I sent to Heaven
49301,Immortal Technique,Produces more digits than twenty two divided by seven
49302,Immortal Technique,Youre like Kevin Spacey your style is usually suspect
49303,Immortal Technique,You never killed a cop you not a motherfuckin thug yet
49304,Immortal Technique,Your mind is empty and spacious
49305,Immortal Technique,Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
49306,Immortal Technique,Face it youre too basic youre never gonna make it
49307,Immortal Technique,Like children walkin through Antarctica butt naked
49308,Immortal Technique, I am content to die for my beliefs
49309,Immortal Technique,So cut off my head and make me a martyr 
49310,Immortal Technique,The people will always remember it  
49311,Immortal Technique,A man who walks with God can walk anywhere
49312,Immortal Technique,The point of guerilla war is not to succeed
49313,Immortal Technique,Its always been just to make the enemy bleed
49314,Immortal Technique,Deprivin the soldiers of the peace of mind that they need
49315,Immortal Technique,Bullets are hard to telegraph when they bob and they weave
49316,Immortal Technique,The only way a guerilla war can ever be over
49317,Immortal Technique,Is when the occupation cant afford more soldiers
49318,Immortal Technique,Until they have to draft the last of you into the service
49319,Immortal Technique,And you refuse because you dont see the purpose
49320,Immortal Technique,The only way to counter the insurgents that are well equipped
49321,Immortal Technique,Is to paint the people fightin for freedom as  terrorists 
49322,Immortal Technique,Then find a faction lookin for foreign investment
49323,Immortal Technique,Install them in power and murder any objections
49324,Immortal Technique,You cant stop a revolution from breathin
49325,Immortal Technique,So to beat em they offer people the illusion of freedom
49326,Immortal Technique,But when youre done dreamin and wake up tortured for treason
49327,Immortal Technique,Then you can see them hidin behind the god they believe in
49328,Immortal Technique,Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
49329,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49330,Immortal Technique,During the night before the start of the dawn
49331,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49332,Immortal Technique,When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
49333,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49334,Immortal Technique,Guerilla war when the army is gone
49335,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49336,Immortal Technique,The purpose of life is a life with a purpose
49337,Immortal Technique,So Id rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless
49338,Immortal Technique,I dont need the circus or the day of national observance
49339,Immortal Technique,I need you to think for you and stop bein a servant
49340,Immortal Technique,Pawns only move a square in the game that theyre used in
49341,Immortal Technique,And realize it too late like the shooting of Huey Newton
49342,Immortal Technique,Or Patrice Lumumba and Salvador Allende
49343,Immortal Technique,Slaughtered by the power hungry branches of their own gente
49344,Immortal Technique,Ghandi wasnt killed by Pakistani nationals
49345,Immortal Technique,He was assassinated by a Hindu radical
49346,Immortal Technique,And Che Guevara rebel to a U S continent
49347,Immortal Technique,Was sold to the C I A by Bolivian communists
49348,Immortal Technique,Wasn t Yitzhak Rabin murdered by a Zionist 
49349,Immortal Technique,And Anwar Sadat a victim of the same violence 
49350,Immortal Technique,Malcolm X was seen as a threat to the F B I 
49351,Immortal Technique,But to blast  em they used Muslims from the N O I 
49352,Immortal Technique,Even the   th President of the Republic
49353,Immortal Technique,Was murdered by factions of his own government
49354,Immortal Technique,So now that it s proven that a soldier of revolution
49355,Immortal Technique,Or head of an empire disguised in a constitution
49356,Immortal Technique,Can not escape the retribution or manipulation
49357,Immortal Technique,Of the self appointed rulers of the planets corporations
49358,Immortal Technique,So Ima need every generation to put your hands up
49359,Immortal Technique, Cause you can only get  em off your back when you stand up
49360,Immortal Technique,Deep in the trenches in the heart of a war
49361,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49362,Immortal Technique,During the night before the start of the dawn
49363,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49364,Immortal Technique,When gunshots are raining in the heart of a storm
49365,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49366,Immortal Technique,Guerilla war when the army is gone
49367,Immortal Technique,Thats the place a martyr is born  Motherfucker its on  
49368,Immortal Technique,I was a man blessed by God
49369,Immortal Technique,To survive some of the worst circumstances
49370,Immortal Technique,I had many things a beautiful woman I loved a home money
49371,Immortal Technique,And I gave it all up to bleed and to die free
49372,Immortal Technique,Sometimes I look back on that life
49373,Immortal Technique,And I wonder what it wouldve been like
49374,Immortal Technique,And in moments of weakness I think about trading it
49375,Immortal Technique,Then I snap the fuck out of it and I get back to my reality
49376,Immortal Technique,And I realize that Im in the heart of a war
49377,Immortal Technique,And thats the place a martyr is born
49378,Immortal Technique,Beware the beast man for he is the Devils pawn Alone among Gods primates he kills for sport or lust or greed Yea he will murder his brother to possess his brothers land Let him not breed in great numbers for he will make a desert of his home and yours Shun him drive him back into his jungle lair for he is the harbinger of death

49390,Immortal Technique,Thatll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life
49391,Immortal Technique,Like Hindu niggas that be bleaching their skin white
49392,Immortal Technique,Other peoples teeth in my hands after a fist fight
49393,Immortal Technique,I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
49394,Immortal Technique,Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
49395,Immortal Technique,Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
49396,Immortal Technique,Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin you

49651,Immortal Technique,Bilderberg is like cancer it grows an infection
49652,Immortal Technique,Nepotism is the gold and the conductors connection
49653,Immortal Technique,And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
49654,Immortal Technique,The military aint there for the peoples protection
49655,Immortal Technique,Theyre just there to protect an investment
49656,Immortal Technique,Thats why people get arrested electrocuted molested
49657,Immortal Technique,Connected streets are infested with those tired of protestin
49658,Immortal Technique,Traumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons
49659,Immortal Technique,    generations pale in comparison

49661,Immortal Technique,That no matter what you think occupation is not victory
49662,Immortal Technique,Immortal Technique disintegrates mics when I spit

49676,Immortal Technique,The righteous and the cannibals
49677,Immortal Technique,But until then I had alien women suck me off
49678,Immortal Technique,When God said  Let there be light  I turned it the fuck off
49679,Immortal Technique,And thats the reason Earth is only five billion years old
49680,Immortal Technique,I made the sun shine and permitted time to unfold
49681,Immortal Technique,The surface was lava but when I stepped down it became cold
49682,Immortal Technique,Fuck what youve been told 
49683,Immortal Technique,My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
49684,Immortal Technique,Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
49685,Immortal Technique,Until the sky started rainin continuous seasons

50025,Immortal Technique,Were here because you were there 
50026,Immortal Technique,Weve arrived from every corner of the planet to this nation to seek the fulfillment of a promise of America We were promised a better life in our home countries where we were told that privatizing water and electricity will make things run more efficiently Instead the quality remained almost the same and the price was increased until it became an unaffordable luxury Some corporations are more efficient than government but their motivation is not the health or the well being of the people its only about profit Everything else their image their human resources their public relations only exist to protect the reality behind it Once upon a time we were told that nationalization would prevent growth by limiting competition that our countries were nothing without the companies that invested in us and so they privatized everything Everything in our country was owned by people that had no connection to our culture by those who never had our interests at heart They didnt care about our survival or well being they just wanted to turn a profit by raping our land by exploiting our people our industry and our resources They took everything we built and made it theirs first by creating racism to justify slavery building the capital for capitalism and then when they gave us what they call liberty everything we had was still owned by them Our governments told us that socialism was the real enemy and that we would have freedom but the foreign powers and corporations were the ones with real freedom the freedom to take all the wealth generated by our work and our land and gave us only a small percentage of the scraps from the table Their lust for power and their greed drove them to betray not only us but themselves and the word of their own God 
50027,Immortal Technique, Open your eyes before you die 
50028,Immortal Technique,And while some used missionaries and donations to off set this abuse other countries and companies were blatant with their crimes using war disease and sanctions that killed millions They supported corrupt governments that were almost like the old slave masters in their oppression of the people because their loyalty was to those who enabled them restored them and kept them in power They became the bastard children of American industry kleptocracy governments of thievery They protected the corporations and went to war against their own people to preserve those profits The puppet rulers were given billions of US tax dollars to fund civil wars right wing death squads execute political dissidents sympathetic clergy and even overthrow democratically elected governments And so the age of revolution began again They painted it as godless terrorist versus the free world and the free market But the free market has never been free because the market does not regulate itself It is manipulated like a puppet and it survives because of its image Destroy the image and the enemy will die Such is the same in the rap industry But the major label super powers treat the underground like the Third World When they need new assets new artists to prostitute a side ins and put on a shelf to use their songs when they needed new concepts music and publishing to steal from the producers they came to the underground to the Third World They took our culture our property and our industry and our resources even using our own people to help them exploit us But behind the mask of efficiency they claimed that we need them to succeed Theyre no better than us Their economic advertising was always a lie A few got rich but most were given an illusion of wealth almost as if it was designed for failure Opportunity comes at the price of the soul in the music so remember what they are underneath the fancy architecture glittering rented jewelry the cars the IMF loans the seeds with suicide jeans    year contracts and oil blood money Build your defenses my independent brothers and sisters They ll stop at nothing to get what they want They paint the Third World underground as savage and backward But the super powers are no less corrupt theyve just learned to disguise it better  cause they fix elections too they embezzle tax money they go to war for resources they fund terrorism for their own benefit And when theres enough at stake historys taught us that theyll even assassinate their own president 
50029,Immortal Technique,Just as the Columbia represents mans highest aspirations in the field of science so too does the struggle of the Afghan people represent mans highest aspiration for freedom and I am dedicating on behalf of the American people the March   nd launch of the Columbia Space Shuttle to the people of Afghanistan

50554,Immortal Technique,El es Tempera y el capitan Immortal
50555,Immortal Technique,Vamos a gritas pa que viva la revoluci n
50556,Immortal Technique,A new American revolution has begun Not against the forces of a colonial kingdom but a rebellion against an oppressor that has risen among us
50557,Immortal Technique,It is not a foreign invasion we have to fear rather the threat of a force within our nation that has usurped what was once a dream of having the greatest democracy ever known to man
50558,Immortal Technique,We now live in a world where the population has grown exponentially
50559,Immortal Technique,And the planet is running out of resources to sustain us all We in the inner city and those struggling in the suburban ghettos may not realize it yet but make no mistake the people who control the technology and run every enterprise that makes up our world have seen this coming for a long time The ideas of renewable energy global warming the idea of collectively working were purposefully bought out derailed demonized or corrupted in favor of an economic structure designed by a monetary caste system
50560,Immortal Technique,In a desperate attempt to convince us that we need to maintain that extravagant existence they ve pretended we might share in their dream
50561,Immortal Technique,That we can justify any inhumanity in its name Out of this blind ignorance was born the curse of slavery Many of the founders of this nation were themselves Masons That is not a Left wing or Right wing conspiracy theory It is a widely known and accepted fact
50562,Immortal Technique,So then explain to me how a nation founded by men who not only understood the long and complicated history of Europe but also that of Africa could permeate such a lie in convincing the American public that one race of men was superior and one inferior When in fact we know that all the early men the people who created civilization and every aspect of what we see today the foundation of all modern human life were from Africa
50563,Immortal Technique,The greatest cowardice of course came not with slavery itself unfortunately But with the excuses for slavery For if America had been as brave as the Roman Empire and all other empires that have come after her and claimed  No we were just stronger and that s why we took you  then when slavery was over racism would ve probably followed in suit
50564,Immortal Technique,But instead it was the social lie the religious lie that was told that stayed in the minds of people that separated one human being from another In order to distract us from the issues of class and freedom they created issues around religion and race to dominate the world for centuries to come
50565,Immortal Technique,Some claim that they respect the culture of life in this country They cry out for indignity of children that are slaughtered before they are born But God has not penetrated their souls for they have no empathy Nothing in their cold hearts for the hundreds of thousands of lives we have taken in our wars overseas for that which they call  collateral damage  which are the burnt and damaged children of the world They have no prayers for them Only snide commentary on the internet and laughter in their hearts And yet you claim to be one with God 
50566,Immortal Technique,We talk about immigration in this country Might doesn t make right ladies and gentleman it just makes right now What we are saying to the rest of the world is one day when America grows weak one day when her legions falter on the day when her economy crumbles   China Russia Europe whatever power has arisen   all you have to do is come here and conquer us in a few military excursions and then you too can set up shop here and in    years you can tell every red blooded American  No you are an illegal human being I am the true citizen I have all the rights You have no rights  
50567,Immortal Technique,Maybe you forgot how you got this country Maybe you take for granted the blood the sweat the tears that the people who live in practical serfdom shed everyday For we may not run America but we make America run
50568,Immortal Technique,We talk about the Law yet how many indignities have been legal in the past How many treaties with Native American people have we broken How many international laws have we violated And speaking of laws how can a corporation be regulated by a government that is funded and controlled by corporations How can there be accountability for people who see a profit margin above the lives of Americans Above the lives of human beings in other countries 
50569,Immortal Technique,We have taken the soul out of ourselves and placed them inside machines
50570,Immortal Technique,My words of course will be marginalized demonized in typical fashion Any time you dare to question the power structure they say you hate America No I love this country I see its beauty every day in its people And I love it a lot more than those who have abandoned the American worker that have chose to exploit and try to take away every single benefit she has those that attempt to make excuses for every atrocity committed in the name of supposed freedom Those who demand accountability from everyone but offer none themselves   who favor contracts over lives   Who favor invasion and control over organic democracy overseas
50571,Immortal Technique,The greatest flaw that any intelligent person has is to think that they re smarter than everyone else And so as the government has planted its spies amongst us we have planted our spies among them They have infiltrated every branch of the American government They have retrieved names data hard numbers The paper trail that will expose those that truly control this country those that control the political parties those that control the oil industry the energy Those that stand behind the companies faceless whose names have never been revealed
50572,Immortal Technique,Hypocrites hookers sex offenders
50573,Immortal Technique,Yall niggas wanna be pimps and players

50586,Immortal Technique,Free markets make money disingenuously

50674,Immortal Technique,Gambling with a bunch of fakes and liars
50675,Immortal Technique,Real talk cause the real New York
50676,Immortal Technique,Is the pain and the suffering of lost love
50677,Immortal Technique,Staring off into the distance in the midst of the club
50678,Immortal Technique,Depression and emptiness that lead to suicide
50679,Immortal Technique,And the struggle inside of yourself that keeps you alive
50680,Immortal Technique,Survived and medicated stalked by sobriety
50681,Immortal Technique,The life that you live now tortured by memories violently
50682,Immortal Technique,I pray inside of me that one day you could be forgiven
50683,Immortal Technique,For murdering the beautiful world we used to live in
50684,Immortal Technique,Love doesnt need a complicated metaphor
50685,Immortal Technique,And sometimes nothin needs to be said at all
50686,Immortal Technique,Sometimes a person youre with is not your one and only
50687,Immortal Technique,And you just fuck with them because you afraid to be lonely
50688,Immortal Technique,And when you come back its too late
50689,Immortal Technique,So you overcompensate like victims of rape full of self hate
50690,Immortal Technique,Lost in the affection to strangers around you
50691,Immortal Technique,Instead of the only person that ever gave a fuck about you
50692,Immortal Technique,Thought you were happy so you didnt come check me
50693,Immortal Technique,But then when he cheated or treated you incorrectly
50694,Immortal Technique,You conveniently realized you could never forget me
50695,Immortal Technique,And tried to crawl back in my life unexpectedly
50696,Immortal Technique,These are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous
50697,Immortal Technique,And leave a trail of broken hearts on their way to enlightment
50698,Immortal Technique,But I cant give into hatred or pass judgment
50699,Immortal Technique,Even towards every illusion Ive been in love with
50700,Immortal Technique,Cause the heart that betrays itself willingly
50701,Immortal Technique,Is like a nation that trades freedom for stability
50702,Immortal Technique,Its so seductive to be cold and corrupted
50703,Immortal Technique,And isolated and try to be an independent republic
50704,Immortal Technique,But liberty to be loved on the surface is worthless
50705,Immortal Technique,The sacrifice of revolution with no purpose
50706,Immortal Technique,Take it from a criminal searching for his redemption
50707,Immortal Technique,Cursing at God desperately trying to get his attention
50708,Immortal Technique,Looking for the shining light

50821,Immortal Technique,Only colored celebrities in the party
50822,Immortal Technique,And left us a legacy of false superiority
50823,Immortal Technique,W E B Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey

50826,Immortal Technique,Banksters modern day gangsters
50827,Immortal Technique,They wanna move us all out the NYC
50828,Immortal Technique,So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
50829,Immortal Technique,Cause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic
50830,Immortal Technique,When they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem
50831,Immortal Technique,They didnt mean that we had stake in that
50832,Immortal Technique,They meant to say that they could make money out of us
50833,Immortal Technique,They are coming in with all kinds of prejudices
50834,Immortal Technique,In Brooklyn theyre doing the same thing

50909,Immortal Technique,You should probably kill yourself
50910,Immortal Technique,Why dont you kill yourself 
50911,Immortal Technique,Look let me make something abundantly clear for people that are so bereft of activities they feel like they gotta comment on every one of mine 
50912,Immortal Technique,First of all being a vegetarian should never be associated with being a revolutionary or being open minded thats a dietary choice 
50913,Immortal Technique,If someone wants to proliferate the type of ignorance were supposed to be fighting by thinking that youre just fuckin yourself 
50914,Immortal Technique,I dont go around promoting beef and poultry shoving it in peoples faces I dont castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches and I would never diss someone for being a fuckin broccoli head or living off radishes or eating grass with tofu 
50915,Immortal Technique,I like a lot of vegan cuisine but the illogicality of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea of what being healthy is is just preposterous 
50916,Immortal Technique,Ive seen some of you herbivores and if you wanna argue health yall need to eat some kind of supplement because some of yall are so skinny that its disgusting 
50917,Immortal Technique,Lookin like the only hip hop motherfuckas on Schindlers list 
50918,Immortal Technique,Being a malnutrition ass got nothing to do with being revolutionary or being on point 
50919,Immortal Technique,Ill be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me 
50920,Immortal Technique,You know I dont eat pork not cause Im a Muslim I just dont really like it but I really will fuck a bird up and fish is good when that shit is fresh

50925,Immortal Technique,Mind your goddamn business 
50926,Immortal Technique,Matter of fact you know what Im out 
50927,Immortal Technique,I feel like asome arroz con pollo a banana daiquiri and a motherfuckin bistec empanado 
50928,Immortal Technique,You have to speak the truth
50929,Immortal Technique,You have to speak your mind
50930,Immortal Technique,Every time I speak my mind Im lyrically critical
50931,Immortal Technique,The pinnacle of being revolutionarily pivotal
50932,Immortal Technique,Beyond anything ever studied thats metaphysical
50933,Immortal Technique,Man fuck a minority Im not politically minimal
50934,Immortal Technique,But obviously terminologies that are statistical
50935,Immortal Technique,Are manufactured to be unequivocally subliminal
50936,Immortal Technique,Transmitted by monopolized media visuals
50937,Immortal Technique,So I riddle hypocritically pitiful criminals
50938,Immortal Technique,Habitually utilizing typical rituals
50939,Immortal Technique,With false pretense in attempts to be spiritual
50940,Immortal Technique,To individuals who believe in Biblical miracles
50941,Immortal Technique,Instead of themselves cause theyre not thinkin original
50942,Immortal Technique,And the color of their skin makes them feel invisible
50943,Immortal Technique,Like microscopic miscarriages lynched with the umbilical
50944,Immortal Technique,Only a fuckin imbecile would think theyre uncorrectable
50945,Immortal Technique,Cause youre susceptible to becomin more than a spectacle
50946,Immortal Technique,Remember that your flesh your blood and your body are dissectable Ill beat you until youre a vegetable
50947,Immortal Technique,And wake up in a hospital covered in poisonous chemicals
50948,Immortal Technique,In a fetal position with your face sewn to your testicles
50949,Immortal Technique,Thinkin that you were kidnapped by extraterrestrials
50950,Immortal Technique,You got heart Im the blood that pumps in your ventricles
50951,Immortal Technique,Technique Im like your soul nigga indispensable
50952,Immortal Technique,With no respect for those who cower at the hour of revolution
50953,Immortal Technique,Cause the government owes my people restitution
50954,Immortal Technique,Instead of sedatives like cocaine and prostitution
50955,Immortal Technique,Conclusion is that youll have to violently silence me
50956,Immortal Technique,Cause I raid the airwaves of cutthroat piracy
50957,Immortal Technique,In school my teachers blinded me but now I can see
50958,Immortal Technique,Now Im mentally and revolutionarily free
50959,Immortal Technique,Broadenin horizons about what my people could be
50960,Immortal Technique,If we wasnt set up to get shot locked or OD
50961,Immortal Technique,You see families bleed because of corporate greed
50962,Immortal Technique,And monopolizin weed is virtually impossible
50963,Immortal Technique,So it wont be legalized and thats another obstacle
50964,Immortal Technique,But Im still rollin up pocket fulls of tropical
50965,Immortal Technique,The governments involved directly so its unstoppable
50966,Immortal Technique,Like a nuclear rocket full of biochemical toxins
50967,Immortal Technique,That invade the ecological
50968,Immortal Technique,Improbable that the average intellect could understand
50969,Immortal Technique,So I encrypted this into hip hop thats in high demand
50970,Immortal Technique,And spread it through the ghetto of every city like contraband
50971,Immortal Technique,Stomp a man of any complexion with a devilish nature
50972,Immortal Technique,Cause Im tryin to save the Earth
50973,Immortal Technique,But youre just gettin in line to rape her
50974,Immortal Technique,Somebody talked shit to me in L A and never lived
50975,Immortal Technique,Cause brown roll deeper than red or blue ever did
50976,Immortal Technique,I got bullets thatll rip through your ribs
50977,Immortal Technique,More painful than watching R Kelly piss on your kids
50978,Immortal Technique,Heres the ultimatum mothafucka
50979,Immortal Technique,Or give America Biggie and  Pac flashbacks
50980,Immortal Technique,Some niggas dont think the Underground is grimy and dirty
50981,Immortal Technique,Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey
50982,Immortal Technique,I fire rockets at generic topics
50983,Immortal Technique,Your lyrics dont hold weight
50984,Immortal Technique,Like two dimensional objects
50985,Immortal Technique,Cause jail culture didnt give you that fitted hat
50986,Immortal Technique,To memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back
50987,Immortal Technique,I wont let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism
50988,Immortal Technique,For a whole generation with their fathers in prison
50989,Immortal Technique,You live inside the image of an Era thats gone
50990,Immortal Technique,Like government officials trying to justify Vietnam
50991,Immortal Technique,Ill leave niggas traumatized like they momma died
50992,Immortal Technique,And they was responsible for the driveby homicide
50993,Immortal Technique,And I dont market revolution I live it
50994,Immortal Technique,What you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick
50995,Immortal Technique,Jealous bickering industry slaves the nerve of you

51089,Immortal Technique,And the more that mcs producers djs
51090,Immortal Technique,And independent labels start to grasp the conceptuality
51091,Immortal Technique,Of what their contribution to the business of hiphop is
51092,Immortal Technique,Rather then just the music  the more the industry will be forced to change
51093,Immortal Technique,Oh  heh and one last thing 
51094,Immortal Technique,You dont have to agree with everything Ive said

51118,Immortal Technique,Cause Im from Harlem the north of Manhattan
51119,Immortal Technique,We knock niggas out and make em bounce like Ricky Hatton
51120,Immortal Technique,But wildin on the corner got me turned back from the Canadian border
51121,Immortal Technique,I knew she was a virgin when I first met her
51122,Immortal Technique,Rockin stockings and poppin out of the catholic school sweater
51123,Immortal Technique,Mom told her she could do better than a criminal
51124,Immortal Technique,Seventeen year old psychotic trying to be lyrical
51125,Immortal Technique,I never meant to break her heart or fuck up her life
51126,Immortal Technique,But I was careless instead of treating her right
51127,Immortal Technique,I seen her again at some club strippin and wondered
51128,Immortal Technique,If I could have made her life different
51129,Immortal Technique, I made a mistake   yes I did    
51130,Immortal Technique, Tech talking over the beat

51139,Immortal Technique,But no body armor in a lightly armored humvee  
51140,Immortal Technique,My familys lonely and you want me to reenlist for   grand homie 
51141,Immortal Technique,When I was young I got signed to a record label

51150,Immortal Technique,But I keep em as a reminder they not killing me
51151,Immortal Technique,And I thank God for teaching me humility
51152,Immortal Technique,Son remember when you fight to be free
51153,Immortal Technique,To see things how they are and not how you like em to be
51154,Immortal Technique,Cause even when the world is falling on top of me
51155,Immortal Technique,Pessimism is an emotion not a philosophy
51156,Immortal Technique,Knowing whats wrong doesnt imply that you right

51166,Immortal Technique,Like a gun with no bullets in the clip for protection
51167,Immortal Technique,Like a crowd packed in the front without the midsection
51168,Immortal Technique,Used to live robbing and stealing and being reckless
51169,Immortal Technique,It took time for my mind to put the ghetto in perspective
51170,Immortal Technique,I used to live in the back of a holding van
51171,Immortal Technique,Used to be offbeat like the white girls shoulder dance
51172,Immortal Technique,I wrote rhymes a acappella no beat behind bars
51173,Immortal Technique,Shed blood to make it like the story behind scars
51174,Immortal Technique,I used to be a battle champion in the meanwhile
51175,Immortal Technique,Before some of you little fuckers learned to freestyle
51176,Immortal Technique,Prematurely senile underground prima donnas
51177,Immortal Technique,I was Oliver North during Iran Contra

51650,Immortal Technique,To think about the origins of Hip Hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are at the very least two worlds in America one of the well to do and another of the struggling For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security it is seen in the gritty roots of Hip Hop For the music arises from a generation that feels with some justice that they have been betrayed by those who came before them that they are at best tolerated in schools feared on the streets and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison They grew up hungry hated and unloved and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty In the broader society the opposite is true for here more than any other place on earth wealth is so wide spread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world Theyre very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence or the U S Department of Justice Theyre just words they have very little relationship to reality Now do you feel safer now Do you think you will anytime soon Do you think duct tape and Kleenex and color codes will make you safer From Death Row this is Mumia Abu Jamal

109989,Scarface,Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
109997,Scarface,I woke up from a dream feeling all good
109998,Scarface,Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing

110007,Scarface,The streets swallow them then life overpower them
110008,Scarface,Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
110009,Scarface,Crash tested a dummy high volume

110011,Scarface,  percent of our futures off in prison
110012,Scarface,Prescription for my mental exorcism
110013,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
110014,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110015,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
110016,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

110117,Scarface,They wanna learn the game from an old school
110118,Scarface,I give em strategies to sleep on
110119,Scarface,So when they put me in the grave they could keep on

110128,Scarface,Its hard enough trynna get by
110129,Scarface,Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
110130,Scarface,And staying drunk on the regular
110131,Scarface,Talking dope talk on your cellular
110132,Scarface,But in this game thats a no no

110143,Scarface,Nigga keep the streets quiet
110144,Scarface,You dont upstrap unless you have to
110145,Scarface,Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
110146,Scarface,Dig two graves just in case its two bodies
110147,Scarface,And never bring a stick to a gunfight
110148,Scarface,One shot one kill you get one life

110150,Scarface,People knowing where you sleep thats a problem
110151,Scarface,You got to watch these niggas
110152,Scarface,They aint your home boys not these niggas
110153,Scarface,First chance you call sleep they could murk you
110154,Scarface,So dont put squares in your circle
110155,Scarface,Cos these streets dont love nobody
110156,Scarface,You gotta pay attention to the signs Johnny
110157,Scarface,If you a weak nigga dont try to play hard
110158,Scarface,Better keep your punk ass out the yard
110159,Scarface,And dont get fronted just avoid that
110160,Scarface,But if you have to pay them boys back
110161,Scarface,Cos niggas aint playing its a drought
110162,Scarface,The border is closed the cash running out
110163,Scarface,And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks

110167,Scarface,And last but not least when you make that money
110168,Scarface,Keep it low pro dont say shit dummy
110169,Scarface,And dont say shit to your girlfriend
110170,Scarface,Pillow talk will send your ass to the state pen
110171,Scarface,Take notes to the game Im providing
110172,Scarface,Stop using momma names trynna hide shit
110173,Scarface,Nigga them feds aint stupid
110174,Scarface,You aint the only nigga trynna do this

110176,Scarface,Flying spur ol rims trynna showboat
110177,Scarface,You drawing too much attention
110178,Scarface,And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
110179,Scarface,The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
110180,Scarface,But once you in it its hard to get out of
110181,Scarface,And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
110182,Scarface,So when you get the chance to make a break for it run fool

111957,Scarface,And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
111958,Scarface,Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
111959,Scarface,And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
111960,Scarface,I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
111961,Scarface,Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
111962,Scarface,And thats the one that can close the shop
111963,Scarface,So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
111964,Scarface,Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
111965,Scarface,But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see 
111966,Scarface,I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin

111969,Scarface,If I dont get lean and blowed everyday
111970,Scarface,I feel just like Imma explode on overload and overdrive
111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
111978,Scarface,But to tell the truth I didnt know myself
111979,Scarface,I found out she had to told me
111980,Scarface,Just to show me just how good I had it
111981,Scarface,Mild mannered I just couldnt be it
111982,Scarface,But that was just the way we used to G it
111983,Scarface,One of the wrongest niggas I see
111984,Scarface,Or one of the strongest niggas I know
111985,Scarface,Walkin on my tippy toe cause the life I live aint long and I know
111986,Scarface,So I put weed in the bong and I blow
111987,Scarface,Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
111988,Scarface,Child that grew into a man thats widely respected
111989,Scarface,But that dont stop our pain
111990,Scarface,Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
111991,Scarface,I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
111992,Scarface,These bitch ass niggas shife
111993,Scarface,Niggas might snitch out they momma
111994,Scarface,Thats why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama

111998,Scarface,At night I talk to God and try to understand
111999,Scarface,How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
112000,Scarface,I guess they already gone aint nothin gone bring them back
112001,Scarface,So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
112002,Scarface,I still love my piece and chain wood grain and big head ones
112003,Scarface,But I had to realize in life everything aint always fun
112004,Scarface,I guess thats true for some

112375,Scarface,As he got older he got even worse
112376,Scarface,Til a real nigga showed him the purpose of a hearse
112377,Scarface,A cold night in his hood he had a tangle
112378,Scarface,The brother he was squabblin with had broke his ankle
112379,Scarface,Laid him out in the driveway

112383,Scarface,He chose the wrong way and thats the route he took
112384,Scarface,Born and brought up as an angel but he died as a crook
