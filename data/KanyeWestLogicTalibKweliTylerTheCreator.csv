68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to

79891,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79892,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79893,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79894,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
79925,Logic,Just like you the person I wrote this for
79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
79928,Logic,And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
79929,Logic,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
79930,Logic,We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
79931,Logic,We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
79932,Logic,Starting with mental health
79933,Logic,We will accept ourselves as we are
79934,Logic,And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror

80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

114595,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
114596,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
114597,Talib Kweli,Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
114598,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible 
114599,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky

114615,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
114616,Talib Kweli,The difference between those who claim to be
114617,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual

116431,Talib Kweli,Just stay bright so shine your light 
116432,Talib Kweli,Were in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux The print the visual artist the musicians   which on the one hand intimidating and on the other immensely liberating The rules the assumptions the now were supposed tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then theyre breaking down The gatekeepers are leaving their gates You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen The old rules are crumbling And nobody knows what the new rules are so make up your own rules
116433,Talib Kweli,Peace peace everything we do is a creation
116434,Talib Kweli,In complete harmony our creation becomes art
116435,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented stems from the human imagination
116436,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented or created
116437,Talib Kweli,That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
116438,Talib Kweli,Science and the empirical man philosophy and the thinker
116439,Talib Kweli,Religion and the shaman art and the sick who can metabolize
116440,Talib Kweli,Everything with a trace of decay is human error
116441,Talib Kweli,Forgivable human error the curse
116442,Talib Kweli,From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
116443,Talib Kweli,Necessary evil so to speak or wed have figured it out by now
116444,Talib Kweli,Striving for perfection is a result of genius
116445,Talib Kweli,Find peace share your genius
116446,Talib Kweli,See I cant see my own face without a reflection
116447,Talib Kweli,Whether it be your reaction to my expression a mirror or water
116448,Talib Kweli,I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
116449,Talib Kweli,Through this understanding I know that all things are one
116450,Talib Kweli,According to science everything is a wave of energy
116451,Talib Kweli,A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
116452,Talib Kweli,My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
116453,Talib Kweli,Which my mind then depicts as images same goes for smell and touch
116454,Talib Kweli,Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
116455,Talib Kweli,Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
116456,Talib Kweli,Time and space disappear Im simply doing
116457,Talib Kweli,Yesterday tomorrow here there poof 
116458,Talib Kweli,It is always now all is energy
116459,Talib Kweli,Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
116460,Talib Kweli,Technically Im only a vessel channeling those thoughts
116461,Talib Kweli,My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
116462,Talib Kweli,Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
116463,Talib Kweli,I believe we all function with the same foundation
116464,Talib Kweli,Energy which is everything
116465,Talib Kweli,Everything is one big ocean of energy
116466,Talib Kweli,Everything is within you everything is you
116467,Talib Kweli,The identity of me is but a series of memories
116468,Talib Kweli,In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
116469,Talib Kweli,The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
116470,Talib Kweli,In other words energy can neither be created or destroyed
116471,Talib Kweli,We are thus forever and death is but a blink
116472,Talib Kweli,So I ask why hurt Why kill Why hate Why fear Why war 
116473,Talib Kweli,Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself 
116474,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116475,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116476,Talib Kweli,If energy only seems to transform then why not 
116477,Talib Kweli,It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
116478,Talib Kweli,We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
116479,Talib Kweli,A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
116480,Talib Kweli,In the same fashion as electrons do
116481,Talib Kweli,Around the nucleus which form the cells which form us
116482,Talib Kweli,Ah yes all is one and my friends it is beautiful
116483,Talib Kweli,Let us unify our heart now feel your power and I thank you
116484,Talib Kweli,Snap ya fingers do ya step
116485,Talib Kweli,The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
116486,Talib Kweli,Delivered hand to hand like we slangin the mixtapes
116487,Talib Kweli,You tryin to describe us you might as well get it straight
116488,Talib Kweli,We the content creators we greater than clickbait
116489,Talib Kweli,The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
116490,Talib Kweli,Its a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
116491,Talib Kweli,We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
116492,Talib Kweli,While I get my energy from the sun all things are one
116493,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116494,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongue
116495,Talib Kweli,My color is my penalty mentally on the run
116496,Talib Kweli,Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun huh
116497,Talib Kweli,Releasing blockages I aint stoppin until they gone
116498,Talib Kweli,Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
116499,Talib Kweli,Until I realized I can change whats going on  lets go  
116500,Talib Kweli,To every single place I go Im right at home
116501,Talib Kweli,Im right at home  lets go  
116502,Talib Kweli,Waiting for that day to come huh
116503,Talib Kweli,Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
116504,Talib Kweli,Get my energy from the sun
116505,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116506,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongues
116507,Talib Kweli,Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
116508,Talib Kweli,Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
116509,Talib Kweli,Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
116510,Talib Kweli,If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth 
116511,Talib Kweli,Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
116512,Talib Kweli,If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
116513,Talib Kweli,Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
116514,Talib Kweli,If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
116515,Talib Kweli,Naturally thats confusion to a youngn trying to follow Christ
116516,Talib Kweli,Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
116517,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
116518,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
116519,Talib Kweli,And who was King James And why did he think that it was so vital
116520,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
116521,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground Heaven is in the sky
116522,Talib Kweli,They say thats where you go when you die but how they know 
116523,Talib Kweli,Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
116524,Talib Kweli,Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
116525,Talib Kweli,I used to study my lessons that was a blessing not a curse
116526,Talib Kweli,I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth word
116527,Talib Kweli,Studied with Rastafarians found out from the dreads that hell
116528,Talib Kweli,Is called Babylon and thats where the crazy boarheads dwell
116529,Talib Kweli,They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
116530,Talib Kweli,But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
116531,Talib Kweli,So it all sound the same to me
116532,Talib Kweli,But when they say ones right and the other is wrong
116533,Talib Kweli,It just sound like game to me
116534,Talib Kweli,Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
116535,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
116536,Talib Kweli,The difference between those that claim to be
116537,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual
116538,Talib Kweli,And recognize that life is full of miracles
116539,Talib Kweli,You can see the flow is divine
116540,Talib Kweli,Cause it coincide with a growing tide
116541,Talib Kweli,Of those looking for God that know to go inside
116542,Talib Kweli,The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
116543,Talib Kweli,Based on his interpretation
116544,Talib Kweli,Of what the words are saying
116545,Talib Kweli,Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
116546,Talib Kweli,Make the Muslim hate the Christian
116547,Talib Kweli,Make the Christian hate the Jew
116548,Talib Kweli,That you condition to and gotta follow
116549,Talib Kweli,But if you ever been to any ghetto then you know it well
116550,Talib Kweli,Lighten it up brighten it up yea
116551,Talib Kweli,You want the grown step your bars up

116555,Talib Kweli,Descendant of Terra Firma Im from the era of legend
116556,Talib Kweli,The blind to my eyesight too scared of the world ending
116557,Talib Kweli,My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
116558,Talib Kweli,Ascending without the stairs expressing without the fears
116559,Talib Kweli,We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
116560,Talib Kweli,Unravelling minds travelling through time like langoliers
116561,Talib Kweli,Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
116562,Talib Kweli,In the park of Washington Square locks in my hair
116563,Talib Kweli,Louder than the bull horns we was locking em there
116564,Talib Kweli,Cops would prepare to lock us up

116569,Talib Kweli,Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
116570,Talib Kweli,Therapy for the prison industrial complex
116571,Talib Kweli,Provided the context for the crime with the TEC  
116572,Talib Kweli,At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
116573,Talib Kweli,I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
116574,Talib Kweli,Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
116575,Talib Kweli,An internal with Puff Daddy in front of the buffed patio
