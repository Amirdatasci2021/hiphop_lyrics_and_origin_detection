98579,NF,Cryin my eyes out in the studio is difficult
98580,NF,Music is the only place that I can go to speak to you
98581,NF,It took everything inside of me not to scream at your funeral
98582,NF,Sittin in my chair that person talkin was pitiful
98583,NF,I wish you were here mama but every time I picture you
98584,NF,All I feel is pain I hate the way I remember you

98602,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98603,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98604,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98605,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98606,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98607,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion
98608,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
98609,NF,Theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
98610,NF,Written all over the floors all over the chairs
98611,NF,And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
98612,NF,Thats where I write when Im in a bad place and need to release
98613,NF,And let out the version of NF you dont wanna see
98614,NF,I put holes in the walls with both of my fists til they bleed
98615,NF,You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
98616,NF,Physically abused now thats the room that I dont wanna be in
98617,NF,That picture aint blurry at all I just dont wanna see it
98618,NF,And these walls aint blank I just think I dont wanna see em
98619,NF,But why not Im in here so I might as well read em
98620,NF,I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
98621,NF,Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
98622,NF,Matter of fact I think Ima burn this room right now
98623,NF,Somehow this memory for some reason just wont come down
98624,NF,You used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
98625,NF,Then took me downstairs and beat me til I screamed and I cried
98626,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98627,NF,But Ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
98628,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98629,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98630,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98631,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98632,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98633,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98634,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98635,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
98636,NF,See my problem is I dont fix things I just try to repaint
98637,NF,Cover em up like it never happened say  I wish I could change 
98638,NF,Are you confused Come upstairs and Ill show you what I mean
98639,NF,This rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
98640,NF,The moment I walk into its the same moment that I wanna leave
98641,NF,I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
98642,NF,But its hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
98643,NF,I look around one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
98644,NF,Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
98645,NF,One of the first things I wrote was  I wish I woulda called 
98646,NF,But I should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
98647,NF,And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
98648,NF,And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
98649,NF,Shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
98650,NF,Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
98651,NF,And I regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
98652,NF,And at the rate Im goin theyll probably still be there when I die
98653,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98654,NF,The question is will I ever clean the walls off in time 
98655,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98656,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98657,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98658,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98659,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98660,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98661,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98662,NF,So this part of my house no ones been in it for years
98663,NF,I built a safe room and I dont let no one in there
98664,NF,Cause if I do theres a chance that they might disappear
98665,NF,And not come back and I admit I am emotionally scared
98666,NF,To let anyone inside so I just leave my doors locked
98667,NF,You might get other doors to open up but this doors not
98668,NF,Cause I dont want you to have the opportunity to hurt me

98672,NF,Im trapped here God keeps saying Im not locked in
98673,NF,I chose this I am lost in my own conscience
98674,NF,I know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
98675,NF,But I didnt build this house because I thought it would solve em
98676,NF,I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
98677,NF,But its not Im not the only thing thats livin in here
98678,NF,Fear came to my house years ago I let him in
98679,NF,Maybe thats the problem cause Ive been dealing with this ever since
98680,NF,I thought that he would leave but its obvious he never did
98681,NF,He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
98682,NF,Now Im in a position its either sit here and let em win
98683,NF,Or put him back outside where he came from but I never can
98684,NF,Cause in order to do that Id have to open the doors

99743,NF,The fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
99744,NF,Well thats pretty convenient cause I just made a plate for em

99758,NF,Now I want you to picture me 
99759,NF,Im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
99760,NF,Staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing  How Could You Leave Us through the speakers on my iPhone
99761,NF,Tryna figure out if Ima always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy

99766,NF,Thats when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
99767,NF,I never cared to impress people that dont even know me
99768,NF,I just write what I feel somehow it started a movement
99769,NF,Trying to enjoy a career but I dont know how to do it
99770,NF,When I spend all of my time being afraid Ima lose it 
99771,NF,But then I figured out the reason they follow me
99772,NF,The reason why these fans surrounding me
99773,NF,Its not cause Im a  Rap God 
99774,NF,I dont need you people to bow to me
99775,NF,All they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
99776,NF,Acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
99777,NF,Im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
99778,NF,This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than Halloween 
99779,NF,Yeah you aint alone out there look around you we got a lot of fans in here
99780,NF,Couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year
99781,NF,Listen to Intro III trying to kill my fear
99782,NF,Theyll get that in a minute
99783,NF,We about to shatter the critics
99784,NF,A lot of baggage I live in
99785,NF,Thats why the passion is different
99786,NF,Really dont care if they get it
99787,NF,Were only three records in it and this is just the beginning
99788,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99789,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99790,NF,If youd open your eyes then maybe youd see whats at stake
99791,NF,Youre sleeping youre sleeping
99792,NF,You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
99793,NF,And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
99794,NF,But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
99795,NF,So what you do then is you start going backwards
99796,NF,And you lookin for something that isnt real
99797,NF,And all you know is that you just gotta have it
99798,NF,What youre doin is sleepin
99799,NF,And thinking that youre awake and youre not
99800,NF,And the problem is that you dont know what youre after
99801,NF,So you put everything that you have into what you do
99802,NF,Hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
99803,NF,But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
99804,NF,Then you look back and you start to regret things
99805,NF,And every time you lookin at yours
99806,NF,You feel like everything you have is a waste 
99807,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
99808,NF,Is because you were never awake
99809,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99810,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99811,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99812,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99813,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99814,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99815,NF,You wake up in the morning
99816,NF,But you feel like you never got up and go to work
99817,NF,And you feelin like you aint got a purpose
99818,NF,And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
99819,NF,Like you aint nothing but worthless
99820,NF,A lot of these other people you lookin at
99821,NF,To you you describe as perfect
99822,NF,So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
99823,NF,And fix ya life up cause nothin is workin 
99824,NF,And you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
99825,NF,But really you feel like everything is crashin around you
99826,NF,And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
99827,NF,Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you 
99828,NF,But every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
99829,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
99830,NF,Is because you were never awake 
99831,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99832,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99833,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99834,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99835,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99836,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99837,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99838,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99839,NF,Only time you ever call me is when you feelin like dont nobody else wanna listen
99840,NF,When s the last time you saw me
99841,NF,You probably don t remember that  cause that was back then you were different
99842,NF,I don t wanna hear the sorry s

99867,NF,They say that you are who you hang with
99868,NF,Maybe that s the reason you been changin
