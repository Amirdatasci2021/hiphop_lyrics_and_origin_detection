68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to

82090,Lupe Fiasco,Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
82091,Lupe Fiasco,Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
82092,Lupe Fiasco,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself
82105,Lupe Fiasco,As most important source of help
82106,Lupe Fiasco,And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
82107,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82108,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
82109,Lupe Fiasco,On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
82110,Lupe Fiasco,It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
82111,Lupe Fiasco,They understand the Internet better than their parents
82112,Lupe Fiasco,Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
82113,Lupe Fiasco,Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
82114,Lupe Fiasco,A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
82115,Lupe Fiasco,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
82116,Lupe Fiasco, Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
82117,Lupe Fiasco,Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches  
82118,Lupe Fiasco,Now lets say that they less concerned with him
82119,Lupe Fiasco,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
82120,Lupe Fiasco,Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
82121,Lupe Fiasco,Reality check Im not trippin
82122,Lupe Fiasco,They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
82123,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82124,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82125,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82126,Lupe Fiasco,Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using  bitch as a lesson
82127,Lupe Fiasco,But as a psychological weapon
82128,Lupe Fiasco,To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
82129,Lupe Fiasco,Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
82130,Lupe Fiasco, Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
82131,Lupe Fiasco,Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
82132,Lupe Fiasco,Sho enough in this little world
82133,Lupe Fiasco,The little boy meets one of those little girls
82134,Lupe Fiasco,And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
82135,Lupe Fiasco,He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
82136,Lupe Fiasco,She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
82137,Lupe Fiasco,He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
82138,Lupe Fiasco,Momma never dressed like that
82139,Lupe Fiasco,Come out the house hot mess like that
82140,Lupe Fiasco,Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
82141,Lupe Fiasco,Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
82142,Lupe Fiasco,He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
82143,Lupe Fiasco, Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
82144,Lupe Fiasco,But  bad mean bad to him  bitch dont play a part
82145,Lupe Fiasco,But  bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
82146,Lupe Fiasco,But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre 
82147,Lupe Fiasco,Tell em bitch bad woman good
82148,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82149,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82150,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82151,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82152,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better greatest motherhood
82153,Lupe Fiasco,Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
82154,Lupe Fiasco,Vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
82155,Lupe Fiasco,To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
82156,Lupe Fiasco,Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
82157,Lupe Fiasco,Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm 
82158,Lupe Fiasco,But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
82159,Lupe Fiasco,So what powers cowards to get them to the top
82160,Lupe Fiasco,Just to fall asleep listening to Bach 
82161,Lupe Fiasco,The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
82162,Lupe Fiasco,Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
82163,Lupe Fiasco,That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
82164,Lupe Fiasco,They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
82165,Lupe Fiasco,Now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling 
82166,Lupe Fiasco,And whats the talking without the match feeling
82167,Lupe Fiasco,Thats buried living And cherry picking
82168,Lupe Fiasco,Every lemon from your berry system
82169,Lupe Fiasco,Then proceed with the pack feeding
82170,Lupe Fiasco,When I was young I had visions of another world
82171,Lupe Fiasco,Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
82172,Lupe Fiasco,Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
82173,Lupe Fiasco,Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
82174,Lupe Fiasco,I like my pancakes cut in swirls
82175,Lupe Fiasco,Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
82176,Lupe Fiasco,I like cartoons southern cities with large moons
82177,Lupe Fiasco,Faith healers ex female drug dealers and art booms
82178,Lupe Fiasco,Apologize for my weird mix
82179,Lupe Fiasco,What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
82180,Lupe Fiasco,And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
82181,Lupe Fiasco,And smells like shotguns and deer piss
82182,Lupe Fiasco,They on their hunt kind of salty that Im going hard
82183,Lupe Fiasco,First part of a party that I throw in parts
82184,Lupe Fiasco,One minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
82185,Lupe Fiasco,But thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
82186,Lupe Fiasco,I run the Gambit like Im throwing cards
82187,Lupe Fiasco,From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
82188,Lupe Fiasco,Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
82189,Lupe Fiasco,Nerd gang make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
82190,Lupe Fiasco,A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
82191,Lupe Fiasco,Backup the wordplay playing at the mans states
82192,Lupe Fiasco,Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
82193,Lupe Fiasco,And when demand brakes Im reflectious what they cant face
82194,Lupe Fiasco,My peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
82195,Lupe Fiasco,The unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
82196,Lupe Fiasco,That hovers above cities like weather men
82197,Lupe Fiasco,Whatever better to tell ya weather comin
82198,Lupe Fiasco,I prefer girls to reign all over the world
82199,Lupe Fiasco,And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
82200,Lupe Fiasco,Or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
82201,Lupe Fiasco,Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
82202,Lupe Fiasco,But reign like Queens that reign over made man
82203,Lupe Fiasco,And not Queen like Queen killer rhapsody bohemian Queen
82204,Lupe Fiasco,But Queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave
82205,Lupe Fiasco,So you make a fan by waving your hand Im talking wave like you saying  Hey man  
82206,Lupe Fiasco,And not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
82207,Lupe Fiasco,You gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
82208,Lupe Fiasco,And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
82209,Lupe Fiasco,And especially when youre recording
82210,Lupe Fiasco,Cause thats the portion thats important
82211,Lupe Fiasco,When I was reporting that I was poor but now Im more than  poor 
82212,Lupe Fiasco,Its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
82213,Lupe Fiasco,Crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops
82214,Lupe Fiasco,Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots

84423,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84424,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through

84426,Lupe Fiasco,A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
84427,Lupe Fiasco,They discover ancient cars on even older streets
84428,Lupe Fiasco,And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
84429,Lupe Fiasco,A culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth
84430,Lupe Fiasco,They can tell that they were civil not barbaric in the least
84431,Lupe Fiasco,A society at peace With liberty and justice for all
84432,Lupe Fiasco,Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
84433,Lupe Fiasco,They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
84434,Lupe Fiasco,That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
84435,Lupe Fiasco,From the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
84436,Lupe Fiasco,Everythings so organized They had to be well behaved
84437,Lupe Fiasco,Assumed they had clean energy little to no enemies
84438,Lupe Fiasco,Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
84439,Lupe Fiasco,Religions kinda complex Kinda hard to figure out
84440,Lupe Fiasco,But this must be the temple
84441,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84442,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84443,Lupe Fiasco,In the same suit that he was buried in
84444,Lupe Fiasco,Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
84445,Lupe Fiasco,Yes he was still fresh to death
84446,Lupe Fiasco,Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
84447,Lupe Fiasco,He still had it cause they couldnt find it
84448,Lupe Fiasco,And the bullets from his enemies
84449,Lupe Fiasco,Sat like two inches behind it
84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
84457,Lupe Fiasco,Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
84458,Lupe Fiasco,He saw that the latch was broken
84459,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84460,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84461,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84462,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84463,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84482,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84483,Lupe Fiasco,Caught the reflection in the window
84484,Lupe Fiasco,Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
84485,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah and gettin back in his lane
84486,Lupe Fiasco,First he had to find something to slang
84487,Lupe Fiasco,Walked right past the same spot
84488,Lupe Fiasco,That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
84489,Lupe Fiasco,It just felt weird being on the opposite
84490,Lupe Fiasco,They figured that he wasnt from there
84491,Lupe Fiasco,So they pulled out and robbed him
84492,Lupe Fiasco,With the same gun they shot him with
84493,Lupe Fiasco,Put it to his head and said
84494,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84495,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84496,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84497,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84498,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84499,Lupe Fiasco,Imma just go   And then well figure it out from there
84500,Lupe Fiasco,They say form follows function
84501,Lupe Fiasco,And if you just function properly things will form themselves

84506,Lupe Fiasco,Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
84507,Lupe Fiasco,Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
84508,Lupe Fiasco,Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
84509,Lupe Fiasco,And they sink in the same sea that we walk
84510,Lupe Fiasco,Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws

98605,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98606,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98607,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion
98608,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
98609,NF,Theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
98610,NF,Written all over the floors all over the chairs
98611,NF,And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
98612,NF,Thats where I write when Im in a bad place and need to release
98613,NF,And let out the version of NF you dont wanna see
98614,NF,I put holes in the walls with both of my fists til they bleed
98615,NF,You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
98616,NF,Physically abused now thats the room that I dont wanna be in
98617,NF,That picture aint blurry at all I just dont wanna see it
98618,NF,And these walls aint blank I just think I dont wanna see em
98619,NF,But why not Im in here so I might as well read em
98620,NF,I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
98621,NF,Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
98622,NF,Matter of fact I think Ima burn this room right now
98623,NF,Somehow this memory for some reason just wont come down
98624,NF,You used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
98625,NF,Then took me downstairs and beat me til I screamed and I cried
98626,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98627,NF,But Ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
98628,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98629,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98630,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98631,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98632,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98633,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98634,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98635,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
98636,NF,See my problem is I dont fix things I just try to repaint
98637,NF,Cover em up like it never happened say  I wish I could change 
98638,NF,Are you confused Come upstairs and Ill show you what I mean
98639,NF,This rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
98640,NF,The moment I walk into its the same moment that I wanna leave
98641,NF,I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
98642,NF,But its hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
98643,NF,I look around one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
98644,NF,Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
98645,NF,One of the first things I wrote was  I wish I woulda called 
98646,NF,But I should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
98647,NF,And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
98648,NF,And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
98649,NF,Shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
98650,NF,Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
98651,NF,And I regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
98652,NF,And at the rate Im goin theyll probably still be there when I die
98653,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98654,NF,The question is will I ever clean the walls off in time 
98655,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98656,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98657,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98658,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98659,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98660,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98661,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98662,NF,So this part of my house no ones been in it for years
98663,NF,I built a safe room and I dont let no one in there
98664,NF,Cause if I do theres a chance that they might disappear
98665,NF,And not come back and I admit I am emotionally scared
98666,NF,To let anyone inside so I just leave my doors locked
98667,NF,You might get other doors to open up but this doors not
98668,NF,Cause I dont want you to have the opportunity to hurt me
98669,NF,And Ill be the only person that I can blame when you desert me
98670,NF,Im barricaded inside so stop watchin
98671,NF,Im not coming to the door so stop knockin stop knockin
98672,NF,Im trapped here God keeps saying Im not locked in
98673,NF,I chose this I am lost in my own conscience
98674,NF,I know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
98675,NF,But I didnt build this house because I thought it would solve em
98676,NF,I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
98677,NF,But its not Im not the only thing thats livin in here
98678,NF,Fear came to my house years ago I let him in
98679,NF,Maybe thats the problem cause Ive been dealing with this ever since

99758,NF,Now I want you to picture me 
99759,NF,Im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
99760,NF,Staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing  How Could You Leave Us through the speakers on my iPhone
99761,NF,Tryna figure out if Ima always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy

99769,NF,Trying to enjoy a career but I dont know how to do it
99770,NF,When I spend all of my time being afraid Ima lose it 
99771,NF,But then I figured out the reason they follow me
99772,NF,The reason why these fans surrounding me
99773,NF,Its not cause Im a  Rap God 
99774,NF,I dont need you people to bow to me
99775,NF,All they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me

99785,NF,Thats why the passion is different
99786,NF,Really dont care if they get it
99787,NF,Were only three records in it and this is just the beginning
99788,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99789,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99790,NF,If youd open your eyes then maybe youd see whats at stake
99791,NF,Youre sleeping youre sleeping
99792,NF,You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
99793,NF,And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
99794,NF,But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
99795,NF,So what you do then is you start going backwards
99796,NF,And you lookin for something that isnt real
99797,NF,And all you know is that you just gotta have it
99798,NF,What youre doin is sleepin
99799,NF,And thinking that youre awake and youre not
99800,NF,And the problem is that you dont know what youre after
99801,NF,So you put everything that you have into what you do
99802,NF,Hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
99803,NF,But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
99804,NF,Then you look back and you start to regret things
99805,NF,And every time you lookin at yours
99806,NF,You feel like everything you have is a waste 
99807,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
99808,NF,Is because you were never awake
99809,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99810,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake

99818,NF,And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
99819,NF,Like you aint nothing but worthless
99820,NF,A lot of these other people you lookin at
99821,NF,To you you describe as perfect
99822,NF,So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
99823,NF,And fix ya life up cause nothin is workin 
99824,NF,And you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
99825,NF,But really you feel like everything is crashin around you
99826,NF,And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
99827,NF,Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you 
99828,NF,But every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
99829,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
99830,NF,Is because you were never awake 
99831,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99832,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99833,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99834,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99835,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99836,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up
