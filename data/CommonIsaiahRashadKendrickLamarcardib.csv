22376,Common,Some say that God is Black and the devils White
22377,Common,Well the devil is wrong and God is whats right
22378,Common,I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
22379,Common,The rain aint gone but I can still see clear
22380,Common,As a child given religion with no answer to why
22381,Common,Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
22382,Common,Curiosity killed the catechism
22383,Common,Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
22384,Common,And became a slave to master self
22385,Common,A rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health
22386,Common,My mind had dealt with the books of Zen Tao the lessons
22387,Common,Quran and the Bible to me they all vital
22388,Common,And got truth within em gotta read them boys
22389,Common,You just cant skim em different branches of belief
22390,Common,But one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em
22391,Common,And use religion as an emblem
22392,Common,When it should be a natural way of life
22393,Common,Who am I or they to say to whom you pray aint right
22394,Common,Thats who got you doing right and got you this far
22395,Common,Whether you say  in Jesus name or  Hum do Allah 
22396,Common,Long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you
22397,Common,You let that show towards others in the things you do
22398,Common,Cause when the trumpets blowin   elders surround the throne
22399,Common,Only        gon get it baby
22400,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22401,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22402,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22403,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me
22404,Common,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn
22405,Common,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
22406,Common,Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
22407,Common,Ive finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
22408,Common,Cause its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place
22409,Common,So I try to find the clue in you
22410,Common,But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
22411,Common,Whyre we being lied to I aint know our history was purposely hidden
22412,Common,Damn something in me wanna know who I am
22413,Common,So I began my search my journey started in church
22414,Common,It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
22415,Common,Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
22416,Common,Taught me survival from this evil Im just gonna have to deal with
22417,Common,And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
22418,Common,It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
22419,Common,Takin elder advice read the Bible the Koran
22420,Common,Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
22421,Common,Hold on this aint right Jesus wasnt White
22422,Common,Some leads were granted with insight
22423,Common,And its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
22424,Common,He still created with the imperfection of man
22425,Common,So with following I disagree
22426,Common,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but
22427,Common,I do know the Devil aint no White man the Devils a spiritual mind
22428,Common,Thats color blind theres evil White folk and evil niggas
22429,Common,You gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity
22430,Common,But one side you gonna have to choose
22431,Common,Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
22432,Common,So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
22433,Common,Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cant follow your lesson
22434,Common,If a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown
22435,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22436,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22437,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22438,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22439,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22440,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22441,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me

71245,Kendrick Lamar,It s actually something a good friend had wrote
71246,Kendrick Lamar,Describing my world it says 
71247,Kendrick Lamar, The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
71248,Kendrick Lamar,Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
71249,Kendrick Lamar,In order to protect itself from this mad city
71250,Kendrick Lamar,While consuming its environment
71251,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
71252,Kendrick Lamar,One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
71258,Kendrick Lamar,Already surrounded by this mad city
71259,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
71260,Kendrick Lamar,Which institutionalizes him
71261,Kendrick Lamar,He can no longer see past his own thoughts
71262,Kendrick Lamar,When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
71263,Kendrick Lamar,Going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
71264,Kendrick Lamar,Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
71265,Kendrick Lamar,Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
71266,Kendrick Lamar,That the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
71267,Kendrick Lamar,Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
71268,Kendrick Lamar,They are one and the same 
71269,Kendrick Lamar,What s your perspective on that

72991,Kendrick Lamar,And once upon a time in a city so divine
72992,Kendrick Lamar,Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
72993,Kendrick Lamar,He was five foot something dazed and confused
72994,Kendrick Lamar,Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
72995,Kendrick Lamar,You can take your boy out the hood but you cant take the hood out the homie
72996,Kendrick Lamar,Took his show money stashed it in the mozey wozey
72997,Kendrick Lamar,Fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service
72998,Kendrick Lamar,Want to reconnect with your elations 
72999,Kendrick Lamar,Look inside these walls and you see Im havin withdrawals
73000,Kendrick Lamar,Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
73001,Kendrick Lamar,Track attire just tell you Im tired and ran away
73002,Kendrick Lamar,I should ask a choir  What do you require
73003,Kendrick Lamar,To sing a song that acquire me to have faith  
73004,Kendrick Lamar,As the record spin I should pray
73005,Kendrick Lamar,For the record I recognize that Im easily prey
73006,Kendrick Lamar,I got animosity buildin its probly big as a buildin
73007,Kendrick Lamar,Me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
73008,Kendrick Lamar,But what am I posed to do when the topic is red or blue
73009,Kendrick Lamar,And you understand that I aint
73010,Kendrick Lamar,But know Im accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
73011,Kendrick Lamar,And live in the street with rank
73012,Kendrick Lamar,No better picture to paint than me walkin from bible study
73013,Kendrick Lamar,And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
73014,Kendrick Lamar,From a function that tooken place they was wonderin if I bang
73015,Kendrick Lamar,Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
73016,Kendrick Lamar,I dont mind cause one day youll respect
73017,Kendrick Lamar,Want to reconnect with your elations 
73018,Kendrick Lamar,All I see is strobe lights blindin me in my hindsight
73019,Kendrick Lamar,Findin me by myself promise me you can help
73020,Kendrick Lamar,In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
73021,Kendrick Lamar,You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
73022,Kendrick Lamar,It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
73023,Kendrick Lamar,I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
73024,Kendrick Lamar,Every time you clock in the morning I feel you just want to kill
73025,Kendrick Lamar,All my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere
73026,Kendrick Lamar,As a better person I know you heard this and probably in fear
73027,Kendrick Lamar,But what am I posed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
73028,Kendrick Lamar,Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
73029,Kendrick Lamar,And you ask  Lift up your shirt  because you wonder if a tattoo
73030,Kendrick Lamar,Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
73031,Kendrick Lamar,Gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
73032,Kendrick Lamar,I heard em chatter  Hes probly young but I know that hes down
73033,Kendrick Lamar,Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
73034,Kendrick Lamar,He dont mind he know well never respect

73038,Kendrick Lamar,Grown up candy for pain can we live in a sane
73039,Kendrick Lamar,Society Its entirely stressful upon my brain
73040,Kendrick Lamar,You hired me as a victim I quietly hope for change
73041,Kendrick Lamar,When violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
73042,Kendrick Lamar,The silence in this room with   s Xannies and shrooms
73043,Kendrick Lamar,Some grown up candy I lost it I feel its nothin to lose
73044,Kendrick Lamar,The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
73045,Kendrick Lamar,Dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid m A A d city

73701,Kendrick Lamar,In her heart she hate it there but in her mind she made it where
73702,Kendrick Lamar,Nothing really matters so she hit the back seat
73703,Kendrick Lamar,Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet
73704,Kendrick Lamar,Fancy girls on Long Beach Boulevard
73705,Kendrick Lamar,Flagging down all of these flashy cars
73706,Kendrick Lamar,And Lord knows shes beautiful
73707,Kendrick Lamar,Lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
73708,Kendrick Lamar,Her anatomy is Gods temple
73709,Kendrick Lamar,And its quite simple her castle is bout to be destroyed
73710,Kendrick Lamar,Shes always paranoid watching the law inside the streets
73711,Kendrick Lamar,Undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
73712,Kendrick Lamar,Remember the sergeant let her slide said if he seen

73716,Kendrick Lamar,Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
73717,Kendrick Lamar,His eyes was closed shut prior charges he had waived em
73718,Kendrick Lamar,It was a block away from Lueders Park I seen a squad car parked

73728,Kendrick Lamar,Of a black man white man needing satisfaction

73731,Kendrick Lamar,But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners redemption
73732,Kendrick Lamar,That sounds foolish and you can blame it on her mother
73733,Kendrick Lamar,For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
