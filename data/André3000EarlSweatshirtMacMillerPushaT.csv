104818,Pusha-T,Snub    with the matte black trigger
104819,Pusha-T,When How Can I Be Down was filled with crack niggas
104820,Pusha-T,This track dictates everything Im supposed to say
104821,Pusha-T,So have mercy on this soul that Ive thrown away
104822,Pusha-T,Although its cliche the devil had a hold of me
104823,Pusha-T,This greedy motherfucker couldnt put the blow away
104824,Pusha-T,Bitches blowing kisses and rappers throwing disses
104825,Pusha-T,Hoping to land their ass on all top  lists
104826,Pusha-T,I wish you niggas well you niggas wish I fail
104827,Pusha-T,You gonna make me bear these arms like a Chippendale
104828,Pusha-T,Squeeze off on him leave cross on him
104829,Pusha-T,By the time the bodies found theres peat moss on him
104830,Pusha-T,I could show all you the ways in which crime pays
104831,Pusha-T,My drug rings a multi million dollar crime wave
104832,Pusha-T,Two ranch homes both dockside
104833,Pusha-T,Get this money back counter clockwise
104834,Pusha-T,Little bubble on the cut like peroxide
104835,Pusha-T,The poison in the car is not carbon monoxide
104836,Pusha-T,I ask forgiveness lord in hopes of getting more
104837,Pusha-T,Then beg forgiveness for the same thing he forgave me for
104838,Pusha-T,I wasnt crazy poor see I was lazy more
104839,Pusha-T,A thousand kilos cross his lines that you cant ignore
104840,Pusha-T,I felt entitled to it not how the bible do it
104841,Pusha-T,My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
104842,Pusha-T,I just took a page then I took the stage
104843,Pusha-T,Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
104844,Pusha-T,I tried to tame the beast best I could no leash
104845,Pusha-T,I stood the test of time air tight no leaks
104846,Pusha-T,Not a squeak not a peep of a word
104847,Pusha-T,I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
104848,Pusha-T,Have mercy on me they put curses on me
104849,Pusha-T,I couldve been six feet or had nurses on me
104850,Pusha-T,It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
104851,Pusha-T,I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me
104852,Pusha-T,You dont do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
104853,Pusha-T,This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
104854,Pusha-T,My Name is My name coming soon
