105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
105374,Royce Da 59,Needless to say that December   th was the day I became a believer in fate
105375,Royce Da 59,Okay now its December   th my day has gone great
105376,Royce Da 59,Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night

105388,Royce Da 59,Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
105389,Royce Da 59,Or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see 
105392,Royce Da 59,I walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son
105393,Royce Da 59,Get to my girl she  centimeters dilated so I waited
105394,Royce Da 59,She got to get to bout nine til its that time
105395,Royce Da 59,And meanwhile Im more popular in this hospital than the doctors
105396,Royce Da 59,Nurses watching whispering like  Thats the one right there
105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show

105406,Royce Da 59,Of different emotions floatin around inside me
105407,Royce Da 59,Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out
105409,Royce Da 59,I saw Kino talkin to Marshall and then he introduced us

105424,Royce Da 59,My grandma didnt live anywhere near that hospital
105425,Royce Da 59,I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
105428,Royce Da 59,It showed me that God is real God is real
