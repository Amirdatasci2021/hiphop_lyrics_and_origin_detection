109939,Scarface,If everything you loved turned into hate

109944,Scarface,Youre underneath the sheet greeting death
109945,Scarface,I wonder when I sleep is he there sitting on my chest
109946,Scarface,Stealing breath shortening my days even less
109947,Scarface,Lost souls never rest a killer walks the streets seeking flesh
109948,Scarface,A adolescent hangs shes depressed
109949,Scarface,A priest who confessed a judged typing a nigga in a text

109959,Scarface,Or try to reason with yourself thats what it is when its not
109960,Scarface,And all the whole while its been a plot
109961,Scarface,To poison our minds and leave us blind to the fact
109962,Scarface,That they keep us in the dark know they act
109963,Scarface,We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
109964,Scarface,Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasnt that
109965,Scarface,The church and these politics they all full of crap
109966,Scarface,Its a shame but thats how were blaming its for the scratch
109967,Scarface,So I dont knock Im tryna to put a black card in my wallet

109988,Scarface,What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
109989,Scarface,Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
109997,Scarface,I woke up from a dream feeling all good
109998,Scarface,Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
109999,Scarface,Lost stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
110000,Scarface,Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out
110001,Scarface,My sister tripping got my grandmother stressing
110002,Scarface,Cause shes only   and shes already pregnant
110003,Scarface,Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
110004,Scarface,Bgs is tripping aint nothing left to stop them
110005,Scarface,Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mammas
110006,Scarface,Cant teach them how to be men grow up being followers
110007,Scarface,The streets swallow them then life overpower them
110008,Scarface,Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
110009,Scarface,Crash tested a dummy high volume
110010,Scarface,Only God can judge but yall niggas is comical
110011,Scarface,  percent of our futures off in prison
110012,Scarface,Prescription for my mental exorcism
110013,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
110014,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110015,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
110016,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

110021,Scarface,I dont wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
110022,Scarface,Plus he knowing how that evil be but who am I
110023,Scarface,To judge a man when I see him try

110728,Scarface,I seen my homies go and come
110729,Scarface,And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from

110735,Scarface,Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
110736,Scarface,So united we stand but we gonna fall quick

110739,Scarface,Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
110740,Scarface,They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
110741,Scarface,They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
110742,Scarface,And now the storys all twisted up
110743,Scarface,And if they gave the cop the chair
110744,Scarface,I really wouldnt give a fuck
110745,Scarface,Because she left my partners family with memories
110746,Scarface,And after hearin this I know you gon remember me

110748,Scarface,I see his parents and then I started breakin up
110749,Scarface,Because I know what you did was wrong
110750,Scarface,But you wont realize until you dead and gone
110751,Scarface,It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
110752,Scarface,You straight up shot him from behind
110753,Scarface,But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
110758,Scarface,Then in reality you took care of your business
110759,Scarface,But regardless I know you wanna kill me
110760,Scarface,But I aint goin out like dat

110778,Scarface,Cause the homies that I thought I had
110779,Scarface,And they just started talkin bad
110780,Scarface,So I stay away from outsiders

110789,Scarface,They tell me see my pastor but I dont go
110790,Scarface,Cause they all be on this one street
110791,Scarface,So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
110792,Scarface,And give my money to the most needy
110793,Scarface,And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
110794,Scarface,Cause their puttin a price tag on a mans word

114588,Talib Kweli,If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth 
114589,Talib Kweli,Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time

114593,Talib Kweli,Naturally thats confusion to a youngn tryna follow Christ
114594,Talib Kweli,Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
114595,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
114596,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
114597,Talib Kweli,Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
114598,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible 
114599,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
114600,Talib Kweli,And they say thats where you go when you die
114601,Talib Kweli,It s bad here on Earth but if we don t get to heaven

114610,Talib Kweli,But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
114611,Talib Kweli,So it all sound the same to me

114613,Talib Kweli,It just sound like game to me
114614,Talib Kweli,Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
114615,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
114616,Talib Kweli,The difference between those who claim to be
114617,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual
114618,Talib Kweli,And recognizing that life is full of miracles
114619,Talib Kweli,You could see my glow in a rhyme
114620,Talib Kweli,The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time

116414,Talib Kweli,Hoping to keep coping copious amounts of opiates
116415,Talib Kweli,Tried to start a union but they blocked me like a Soviet
116416,Talib Kweli,I hope they get it Im sick of explaining history

116430,Talib Kweli,If youve gotta dim yours so they can shine brighter
116431,Talib Kweli,Just stay bright so shine your light 
116432,Talib Kweli,Were in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux The print the visual artist the musicians   which on the one hand intimidating and on the other immensely liberating The rules the assumptions the now were supposed tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then theyre breaking down The gatekeepers are leaving their gates You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen The old rules are crumbling And nobody knows what the new rules are so make up your own rules
116433,Talib Kweli,Peace peace everything we do is a creation
116434,Talib Kweli,In complete harmony our creation becomes art
116435,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented stems from the human imagination
116436,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented or created
116437,Talib Kweli,That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
116438,Talib Kweli,Science and the empirical man philosophy and the thinker
116439,Talib Kweli,Religion and the shaman art and the sick who can metabolize
116440,Talib Kweli,Everything with a trace of decay is human error
116441,Talib Kweli,Forgivable human error the curse
116442,Talib Kweli,From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
116443,Talib Kweli,Necessary evil so to speak or wed have figured it out by now
116444,Talib Kweli,Striving for perfection is a result of genius
116445,Talib Kweli,Find peace share your genius
116446,Talib Kweli,See I cant see my own face without a reflection
116447,Talib Kweli,Whether it be your reaction to my expression a mirror or water
116448,Talib Kweli,I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
116449,Talib Kweli,Through this understanding I know that all things are one
116450,Talib Kweli,According to science everything is a wave of energy
116451,Talib Kweli,A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
116452,Talib Kweli,My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
116453,Talib Kweli,Which my mind then depicts as images same goes for smell and touch
116454,Talib Kweli,Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
116455,Talib Kweli,Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
116456,Talib Kweli,Time and space disappear Im simply doing
116457,Talib Kweli,Yesterday tomorrow here there poof 
116458,Talib Kweli,It is always now all is energy
116459,Talib Kweli,Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
116460,Talib Kweli,Technically Im only a vessel channeling those thoughts
116461,Talib Kweli,My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
116462,Talib Kweli,Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
116463,Talib Kweli,I believe we all function with the same foundation
116464,Talib Kweli,Energy which is everything
116465,Talib Kweli,Everything is one big ocean of energy
116466,Talib Kweli,Everything is within you everything is you
116467,Talib Kweli,The identity of me is but a series of memories
116468,Talib Kweli,In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
116469,Talib Kweli,The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
116470,Talib Kweli,In other words energy can neither be created or destroyed
116471,Talib Kweli,We are thus forever and death is but a blink
116472,Talib Kweli,So I ask why hurt Why kill Why hate Why fear Why war 
116473,Talib Kweli,Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself 
116474,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116475,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116476,Talib Kweli,If energy only seems to transform then why not 
116477,Talib Kweli,It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
116478,Talib Kweli,We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
116479,Talib Kweli,A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
116480,Talib Kweli,In the same fashion as electrons do
116481,Talib Kweli,Around the nucleus which form the cells which form us
116482,Talib Kweli,Ah yes all is one and my friends it is beautiful
116483,Talib Kweli,Let us unify our heart now feel your power and I thank you
116484,Talib Kweli,Snap ya fingers do ya step

116487,Talib Kweli,You tryin to describe us you might as well get it straight
116488,Talib Kweli,We the content creators we greater than clickbait
116489,Talib Kweli,The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
116490,Talib Kweli,Its a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
116491,Talib Kweli,We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
116492,Talib Kweli,While I get my energy from the sun all things are one
116493,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116494,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongue
116495,Talib Kweli,My color is my penalty mentally on the run
116496,Talib Kweli,Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun huh
116497,Talib Kweli,Releasing blockages I aint stoppin until they gone
116498,Talib Kweli,Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
116499,Talib Kweli,Until I realized I can change whats going on  lets go  
116500,Talib Kweli,To every single place I go Im right at home
116501,Talib Kweli,Im right at home  lets go  
116502,Talib Kweli,Waiting for that day to come huh
116503,Talib Kweli,Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
116504,Talib Kweli,Get my energy from the sun
116505,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116506,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongues
116507,Talib Kweli,Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
116508,Talib Kweli,Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
116509,Talib Kweli,Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
116510,Talib Kweli,If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth 
116511,Talib Kweli,Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
116512,Talib Kweli,If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
116513,Talib Kweli,Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
116514,Talib Kweli,If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
116515,Talib Kweli,Naturally thats confusion to a youngn trying to follow Christ
116516,Talib Kweli,Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
116517,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
116518,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
116519,Talib Kweli,And who was King James And why did he think that it was so vital
116520,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
116521,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground Heaven is in the sky
116522,Talib Kweli,They say thats where you go when you die but how they know 
116523,Talib Kweli,Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
116524,Talib Kweli,Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
116525,Talib Kweli,I used to study my lessons that was a blessing not a curse
116526,Talib Kweli,I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth word
116527,Talib Kweli,Studied with Rastafarians found out from the dreads that hell
116528,Talib Kweli,Is called Babylon and thats where the crazy boarheads dwell
116529,Talib Kweli,They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
116530,Talib Kweli,But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
116531,Talib Kweli,So it all sound the same to me
116532,Talib Kweli,But when they say ones right and the other is wrong
116533,Talib Kweli,It just sound like game to me
116534,Talib Kweli,Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
116535,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
116536,Talib Kweli,The difference between those that claim to be
116537,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual
116538,Talib Kweli,And recognize that life is full of miracles
116539,Talib Kweli,You can see the flow is divine
116540,Talib Kweli,Cause it coincide with a growing tide
116541,Talib Kweli,Of those looking for God that know to go inside
116542,Talib Kweli,The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
116543,Talib Kweli,Based on his interpretation
116544,Talib Kweli,Of what the words are saying
116545,Talib Kweli,Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
116546,Talib Kweli,Make the Muslim hate the Christian
116547,Talib Kweli,Make the Christian hate the Jew
116548,Talib Kweli,That you condition to and gotta follow
116549,Talib Kweli,But if you ever been to any ghetto then you know it well
116550,Talib Kweli,Lighten it up brighten it up yea

116558,Talib Kweli,Ascending without the stairs expressing without the fears
116559,Talib Kweli,We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
116560,Talib Kweli,Unravelling minds travelling through time like langoliers
116561,Talib Kweli,Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
116562,Talib Kweli,In the park of Washington Square locks in my hair
116563,Talib Kweli,Louder than the bull horns we was locking em there
116564,Talib Kweli,Cops would prepare to lock us up

116570,Talib Kweli,Therapy for the prison industrial complex
116571,Talib Kweli,Provided the context for the crime with the TEC  
116572,Talib Kweli,At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
