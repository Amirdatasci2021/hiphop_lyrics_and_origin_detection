22674,Common,We make this movement towards freedom
22675,Common,For all those who have been oppressed and all those in the struggle
22676,Common,There were lights and sirens gunshots firing
22677,Common,Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
22678,Common,Seemed like a bad dream she laid in a blood puddle
22679,Common,Blood bubbled in her chest cold air brushed against open flesh
22680,Common,No room to rest pain consumed each breath
22681,Common,Shot twice with her hands up
22682,Common,Police questioned but shot before she answered
22683,Common,One Panther lost his life the other ran for his
22684,Common,Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
22685,Common,Comprehension she was beyond trying to hold on
22686,Common,To life She thought shed live with no arm
22687,Common,Thats what it felt like got to the hospital eyes held tight
22688,Common,They moved her room to room she could tell by the light
22689,Common,Handcuffed tight to the bed through her skin it bit
22690,Common,Put guns to her head every word she got hit
22691,Common, Who shot the trooper  they asked her
22692,Common,Put mace in her eyes threatened to blast her
22693,Common,Her mind raced till things got still
22694,Common,Opened her eyes realized shes next to her best friend who got killed
22695,Common,She got chills they told her thats where she would be next
22696,Common,Hurt mixed wit anger survival was a reflex
22697,Common,They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
22698,Common,But she was building as they tried to destroy her
22699,Common,If it wasnt for this German nurse they wouldve served her worse
22700,Common,I read this sisters story knew that it deserved a verse
22701,Common,I wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me 
22702,Common,All of this just so we could be free

22705,Common,It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
22706,Common,Walkie talkies crackling I see them when theyre taking her
22707,Common,What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
22708,Common,Arrived to Middlesex Prison about  in the morning
22709,Common,Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
22710,Common,A cell one cot no window facing hell
22711,Common,Put in the basement of a prison with all males
22712,Common,And the smell of misery seatless toilets and centipedes
22713,Common,Shed exercise paint and begin to read
22714,Common,Two years in a hole her soul grew weak
22715,Common,Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
22716,Common,She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
22717,Common,And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
22718,Common,Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
22719,Common,One of the brothers she had a child with
22720,Common,The foulness they would feed her hoping shes lose her seed
22721,Common,Held tight knowing the fight would live through this seed
22722,Common,In need of a doctor from her stomach shed bleed
22723,Common,Out of this situation a girl was conceived
22724,Common,Separated from her left to mother the Revolution
22725,Common,And lactated to attack hate
22726,Common,Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
22727,Common,Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
22728,Common,They fabricated cases hoping one would stick
22729,Common,And said she robbed places that didnt exist
22730,Common,In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
22731,Common,Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
22732,Common,I wonder what would happen if that wouldve been me

22748,Common,Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
22749,Common,Time for her to breathe and not be told how or when
22750,Common,She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
22751,Common,How she broke out of prison I could never explain
22752,Common,And even to this day they try to get to her
