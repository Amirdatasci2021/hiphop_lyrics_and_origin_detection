105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice

105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see

105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show

105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce

109988,Scarface,What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
109989,Scarface,Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
109997,Scarface,I woke up from a dream feeling all good
109998,Scarface,Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
109999,Scarface,Lost stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out

110005,Scarface,Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mammas
110006,Scarface,Cant teach them how to be men grow up being followers
110007,Scarface,The streets swallow them then life overpower them
110008,Scarface,Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
110009,Scarface,Crash tested a dummy high volume
110010,Scarface,Only God can judge but yall niggas is comical
110011,Scarface,  percent of our futures off in prison
110012,Scarface,Prescription for my mental exorcism
110013,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
110014,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110015,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
110016,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
110017,Scarface,Another kid killed in cold blood a mothers heart broke

110021,Scarface,I dont wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
110022,Scarface,Plus he knowing how that evil be but who am I
110023,Scarface,To judge a man when I see him try
110024,Scarface,FOX news tried to justify him
110025,Scarface,And aint no way that you can clarify
110026,Scarface,In cold blood our lil homies dying
110027,Scarface,Another sign of the times but its terrifying
110028,Scarface,That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk

110034,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
110035,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110036,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud

110750,Scarface,But you wont realize until you dead and gone
110751,Scarface,It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
110752,Scarface,You straight up shot him from behind
110753,Scarface,But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
110758,Scarface,Then in reality you took care of your business
110759,Scarface,But regardless I know you wanna kill me
110760,Scarface,But I aint goin out like dat

111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
