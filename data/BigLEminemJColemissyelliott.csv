39404,Eminem,Further away it drove us but together headlights shine,9
39405,Eminem,And a car full of belongings still got a ways to go,12
39406,Eminem,Back to grandmas house its straight up the road,9
39407,Eminem,And I was the man of the house the oldest,10
39408,Eminem,So my shoulders carried the weight of the load,9
39409,Eminem,Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old,12
39410,Eminem,And thats when I realized you were sick,8
39411,Eminem,And it wasnt fixable or changeable,6
39412,Eminem,And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though but ,13
39413,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on,9
39414,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far,6
39415,Eminem, Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though,12

39421,Eminem,That song I no longer play at shows,8
39422,Eminem,And I cringe every time its on the radio,9
39423,Eminem,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home,10
39424,Eminem,And all the medicine you fed us and,8
39425,Eminem,How I just wanted you to taste your own,9
39426,Eminem,But now the medications takin over,6

40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know,9
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is,9
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song,9
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped,11
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault,6
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong,6
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on,10
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent,6
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan,6
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog,8
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls,4
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft,11
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws,11
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then,7
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it,10
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought,9
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught,11
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered,9
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not ,6
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on,13
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful,6
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon,8
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss,7
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face,8
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off,6
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet,7
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it,12
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah,12
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times,10
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing,9
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme ,4
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt,24
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to ,14
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound,9
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out,10
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round,6
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up,8
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love,9
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone,6
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run,9
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near,7
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear,7
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round,10
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear,9
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to,7
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over,6
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know,9
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once,10
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance,5
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world,10
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on,8
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song,10
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark,11
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit,5
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off,10
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part,12
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck,10
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art,6
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused,14
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone,11
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park,9
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen,18
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from,10
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun,11
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song,14
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   ,6
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah,8
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent,6
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs,8
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God,8
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on,7
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools,8
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong,7
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt,11
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt,12
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self,7
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk,8
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the,9
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium,11
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house,8
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done,12
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did,11
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted,8
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar,7
