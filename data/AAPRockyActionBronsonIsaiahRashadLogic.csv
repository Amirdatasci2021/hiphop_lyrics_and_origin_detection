79717,Logic,He always saw things from two sides
79718,Logic,He always knew that the message
79719,Logic,Regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation
79720,Logic,He knew that because he saw that
79721,Logic, Take it back take it way back
79722,Logic,Because he was stripped and torn down
79723,Logic,By his black brothers and sisters that were uneducated
79724,Logic,And he was stripped and he was torn down
79725,Logic,By his white side that did not know
79726,Logic,These people that are ignorant
79727,Logic,That cannot see the bigger picture
79728,Logic,That must fight and kill and murder each other

79738,Logic,Running around with the wrong people
79739,Logic,Running around with guns and knives
79740,Logic,And fighting and stealing and and all this
79741,Logic,Because he didn t know he didn t know 
79742,Logic,But he knew deep down in his heart that it wasn t right
79743,Logic,And he knew that he needed to get away from it
79744,Logic,Now I want you to also imagine that at   years old
79745,Logic,This child okay leaves home and gets two jobs to support himself
79746,Logic,Two jobs that he works in the morning and the evenings
79747,Logic,And then he would then come home

79749,Logic,But spend four five six hours of that
79750,Logic,Working on music persevering
79751,Logic,Grabbing the remote control and looking in the mirror
79752,Logic,And pretending to see thousands and thousands and thousands of people

79760,Logic,He said equality for all man
79761,Logic,Regardless of race religion color creed and sexual orientation yeah
79762,Logic,Now I want you to also imagine
79763,Logic,People telling him that he did not live this life

79771,Logic,And since you white you gotta have money right  
79772,Logic, Take it back take it way back
79773,Logic,Take it way way back to the first black man 
79774,Logic,And this young man persevered in spite
79775,Logic,Of what people told him he was wasn t and would never be
79776,Logic, Take it back take it way back

79783,Logic,There s extremists on every side
79784,Logic,And you should just do your best to live life
79785,Logic,And let other people believe whatever they wanna believe
79786,Logic,As long as they re not hurtin anybody
79787,Logic,You can believe they re going to hell
79788,Logic,You can believe it s not right
79789,Logic,You can believe you re superior fine

79894,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
79925,Logic,Just like you the person I wrote this for
79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
79928,Logic,And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
79929,Logic,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
79930,Logic,We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
79931,Logic,We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
79932,Logic,Starting with mental health
79933,Logic,We will accept ourselves as we are
79934,Logic,And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror

80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

80886,Logic,I write it so that the people can feel better
80887,Logic,That have gone through what Ive gone through
80888,Logic,Memories of a perfect love thats broken and haunt you

81940,Logic,Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then yeah yeah
81941,Logic,But Im not defined by the sales of my first week

81944,Logic,Compiled of different races gathering from different places
81945,Logic,I just contemplate shout out to those who can relate
81946,Logic,And even though it gets hard I know my fate
