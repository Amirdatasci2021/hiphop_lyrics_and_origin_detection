22374,Common,Being my bloodline is one with the divine
22375,Common,In time brother you will discover the light
22376,Common,Some say that God is Black and the devils White
22377,Common,Well the devil is wrong and God is whats right
22378,Common,I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
22379,Common,The rain aint gone but I can still see clear
22380,Common,As a child given religion with no answer to why
22381,Common,Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
22382,Common,Curiosity killed the catechism
22383,Common,Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
22384,Common,And became a slave to master self
22385,Common,A rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health
22386,Common,My mind had dealt with the books of Zen Tao the lessons
22387,Common,Quran and the Bible to me they all vital
22388,Common,And got truth within em gotta read them boys
22389,Common,You just cant skim em different branches of belief
22390,Common,But one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em
22391,Common,And use religion as an emblem
22392,Common,When it should be a natural way of life
22393,Common,Who am I or they to say to whom you pray aint right
22394,Common,Thats who got you doing right and got you this far
22395,Common,Whether you say  in Jesus name or  Hum do Allah 
22396,Common,Long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you
22397,Common,You let that show towards others in the things you do
22398,Common,Cause when the trumpets blowin   elders surround the throne
22399,Common,Only        gon get it baby
22400,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22401,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22402,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22403,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me
22404,Common,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn
22405,Common,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
22406,Common,Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
22407,Common,Ive finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
22408,Common,Cause its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place
22409,Common,So I try to find the clue in you
22410,Common,But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
22411,Common,Whyre we being lied to I aint know our history was purposely hidden
22412,Common,Damn something in me wanna know who I am
22413,Common,So I began my search my journey started in church
22414,Common,It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
22415,Common,Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
22416,Common,Taught me survival from this evil Im just gonna have to deal with
22417,Common,And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
22418,Common,It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
22419,Common,Takin elder advice read the Bible the Koran
22420,Common,Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
22421,Common,Hold on this aint right Jesus wasnt White
22422,Common,Some leads were granted with insight
22423,Common,And its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
22424,Common,He still created with the imperfection of man
22425,Common,So with following I disagree
22426,Common,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but
22427,Common,I do know the Devil aint no White man the Devils a spiritual mind
22428,Common,Thats color blind theres evil White folk and evil niggas
22429,Common,You gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity
22430,Common,But one side you gonna have to choose
22431,Common,Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
22432,Common,So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
22433,Common,Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cant follow your lesson
22434,Common,If a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown
22435,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22436,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22437,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22438,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22439,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22440,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22441,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me

110117,Scarface,They wanna learn the game from an old school
110118,Scarface,I give em strategies to sleep on
110119,Scarface,So when they put me in the grave they could keep on

110130,Scarface,And staying drunk on the regular
110131,Scarface,Talking dope talk on your cellular
110132,Scarface,But in this game thats a no no

110144,Scarface,You dont upstrap unless you have to
110145,Scarface,Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
110146,Scarface,Dig two graves just in case its two bodies

110152,Scarface,They aint your home boys not these niggas
110153,Scarface,First chance you call sleep they could murk you

110158,Scarface,Better keep your punk ass out the yard
110159,Scarface,And dont get fronted just avoid that
110160,Scarface,But if you have to pay them boys back
110161,Scarface,Cos niggas aint playing its a drought
110162,Scarface,The border is closed the cash running out

110178,Scarface,And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
110179,Scarface,The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
110180,Scarface,But once you in it its hard to get out of
110181,Scarface,And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do

111954,Scarface, It aint no muthafuckin peace when they see me 
111955,Scarface,Cause we never had a muthafuckin peace treaty
111956,Scarface,So I know I got to get em with game
111957,Scarface,And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
111958,Scarface,Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
111959,Scarface,And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
111960,Scarface,I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
111961,Scarface,Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
111962,Scarface,And thats the one that can close the shop
111963,Scarface,So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
111964,Scarface,Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
111965,Scarface,But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see 
111966,Scarface,I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
111967,Scarface,But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
111968,Scarface,And the nigga that tried to pull it
111969,Scarface,If I dont get lean and blowed everyday
111970,Scarface,I feel just like Imma explode on overload and overdrive
111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
111978,Scarface,But to tell the truth I didnt know myself
111979,Scarface,I found out she had to told me
111980,Scarface,Just to show me just how good I had it
111981,Scarface,Mild mannered I just couldnt be it
111982,Scarface,But that was just the way we used to G it
111983,Scarface,One of the wrongest niggas I see
111984,Scarface,Or one of the strongest niggas I know
111985,Scarface,Walkin on my tippy toe cause the life I live aint long and I know
111986,Scarface,So I put weed in the bong and I blow
111987,Scarface,Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
111988,Scarface,Child that grew into a man thats widely respected
111989,Scarface,But that dont stop our pain
111990,Scarface,Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
111991,Scarface,I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
111992,Scarface,These bitch ass niggas shife
111993,Scarface,Niggas might snitch out they momma
111994,Scarface,Thats why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama

111996,Scarface,But nigga you promised to die
111997,Scarface,Nigga cant you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
111998,Scarface,At night I talk to God and try to understand
111999,Scarface,How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
112000,Scarface,I guess they already gone aint nothin gone bring them back
112001,Scarface,So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
112002,Scarface,I still love my piece and chain wood grain and big head ones
112003,Scarface,But I had to realize in life everything aint always fun
112004,Scarface,I guess thats true for some
112005,Scarface,But them hoes will never win
112006,Scarface,Out here just hustlin and grindin
