104966,Royce Da 59,And as a family we was just so happy
104967,Royce Da 59,When him and mama got along on the Bob Lo boat
104968,Royce Da 59,Uh on our way to that black amusement park
104969,Royce Da 59,Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
104970,Royce Da 59,Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court
104971,Royce Da 59,Broken glass waiting on you on the swimming pool floor
104972,Royce Da 59,I came across my identity on the Bob Lo boat
104973,Royce Da 59,That s where I lost my virginity no condom though
104974,Royce Da 59,That s when paranoia hit me like when superstition does
104975,Royce Da 59,Left my inhibitions I guess where my supervision was
104976,Royce Da 59,Parties on the way to the island would be the livest though
104977,Royce Da 59,First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Bob Lo boat
104978,Royce Da 59,But neither one of us knew that we would both
104979,Royce Da 59,Grow up and turn to alcoholics though the Bob Lo boat

104999,Royce Da 59,This was my main concern back when concerns were lesser
105000,Royce Da 59,Nowadays I often yearn to press the
105001,Royce Da 59,Backspace button or hit return but life is not no word processor
105002,Royce Da 59,Most folks would burn the sess to burn the stress of
105003,Royce Da 59,My real life trauma plus fickle niggas thinking they done heard the best of

105338,Royce Da 59,I promised not to lie in not one of these verses
105339,Royce Da 59,I started out as a battle rapper
105340,Royce Da 59,All I knew was Maxells ADATs DATs and gats
105341,Royce Da 59,Uh my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
105342,Royce Da 59,Recovering alcoholic I grew up on  Mile
105343,Royce Da 59,Uh Im not a gangster drug dealer or thug nigga
105344,Royce Da 59,Just an MC who made a name with his rhyme style
105345,Royce Da 59,Now sometime around   I found my calling
105346,Royce Da 59,And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
105347,Royce Da 59,Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
105348,Royce Da 59,But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
105349,Royce Da 59,My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
105350,Royce Da 59,Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
105351,Royce Da 59,My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter
105352,Royce Da 59,And listen to Redman and Heltah Skeltah
105353,Royce Da 59,Aye yall remember that one joint from the Heltah Skeltah album called 
105354,Royce Da 59,Sean Price be like  Im not sure any  yeah that was my shit
105355,Royce Da 59,I used to bump that shit all day 
105356,Royce Da 59,By this time I knew I wanted to be an artist
105357,Royce Da 59,I didnt want to be anything else
105358,Royce Da 59,You know but my mom had plans for me
105359,Royce Da 59,She wanted me to go to school so you know
105360,Royce Da 59,Uh to make moms happy I took some general courses in college
105361,Royce Da 59,Took the bus until I got hella bored with that
105362,Royce Da 59,Because the bus stop I had to walk to
105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
105374,Royce Da 59,Needless to say that December   th was the day I became a believer in fate
105375,Royce Da 59,Okay now its December   th my day has gone great
105376,Royce Da 59,Kino booked me a show under contract to do that night
105377,Royce Da 59,I got a call from my girls people saying shes in labor
105378,Royce Da 59,In the hospital right now  th floor
105379,Royce Da 59,I get on the elevator elevator stops on the  th floor
105380,Royce Da 59,Elevator opens up my uncles standing there crying
105381,Royce Da 59,Now Im caught off guard Im like  What the fuck  
105382,Royce Da 59,My uncle standing there like  Ryan they that way 
105383,Royce Da 59,I walk out I see my momma and that entire side of my family

105386,Royce Da 59,And it aint looking good  Im like  Man what  
105387,Royce Da 59,Im having a baby four floors up before I froze up
105388,Royce Da 59,Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
105389,Royce Da 59,Or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see 
105392,Royce Da 59,I walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son
105393,Royce Da 59,Get to my girl she  centimeters dilated so I waited
105394,Royce Da 59,She got to get to bout nine til its that time
105395,Royce Da 59,And meanwhile Im more popular in this hospital than the doctors
105396,Royce Da 59,Nurses watching whispering like  Thats the one right there
105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show
105399,Royce Da 59,Somebody had to remind me the doors was already open at the venue
105400,Royce Da 59,I got emotions runnin every which way
105401,Royce Da 59,All the nurses and stuff is like  Well keep you posted about the baby
105402,Royce Da 59,Well keep you posted about your granny  
105403,Royce Da 59,I didnt like seeing my mama like that so I had to get out of there
105404,Royce Da 59,Yeah I hit the stage at       killed it
105405,Royce Da 59,I got off at about midnight with about six types
105406,Royce Da 59,Of different emotions floatin around inside me
105407,Royce Da 59,Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out
105409,Royce Da 59,I saw Kino talkin to Marshall and then he introduced us
105410,Royce Da 59,We talked about collaboratin and how chasin this rap thing is aggravatin
105411,Royce Da 59,But Ill get back I got the family waitin
105412,Royce Da 59,As soon as I get to the hospital they tell me that my granny didnt make it
105413,Royce Da 59,She just died Im feelin helpless it hurt me
105414,Royce Da 59,On the flip side my little boy is healthy in the nursery
105415,Royce Da 59,I picked him up looked in his eyes for the first time and just cried
105416,Royce Da 59,Aint no denyin this is the power of God
105417,Royce Da 59,I said  I love you Granny and looked to the sky

105424,Royce Da 59,My grandma didnt live anywhere near that hospital
105425,Royce Da 59,I learned that the universe has this way of balancing itself out
105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
105428,Royce Da 59,It showed me that God is real God is real
