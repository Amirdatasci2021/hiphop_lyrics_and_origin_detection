47472,Ice Cube,Hey Bone hey nigga where you at though 
47473,Ice Cube,And Ill be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles
47474,Ice Cube,How to survive in South Central  what you do  
47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive
47487,Ice Cube,Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles 
47488,Ice Cube,Or has somebody taken your things 
47489,Ice Cube,Have you witnessed a driveby

47499,Ice Cube,In either L A  Compton or Watts
47500,Ice Cube,Pissed off black human beings
47501,Ice Cube,So I think you better skip the sight seeing
47502,Ice Cube,And if youre nuttin but a mark
47503,Ice Cube,Make sure that youre in before dark
47504,Ice Cube,But if you need some affection mate

47523,Ice Cube,To an undercover or the wrong brother

47848,Ice Cube,Over colors cuz brothas dont know the deal
47849,Ice Cube,And theyll cap you not if they have to
47850,Ice Cube,But if they want to first they might confront you

47852,Ice Cube,And he wont stop and he dont stop
47853,Ice Cube,Not to the bang bang boogie but they like to gangbang
47854,Ice Cube,And rookies aint the only ones that drop
47855,Ice Cube,Some say the little locs are gettin a little too loced
47856,Ice Cube,And when it comes to dust they kick up the most

47866,Ice Cube,And no sooner do I get out seems like Im right back in jail
47867,Ice Cube,For some gang related activity
47868,Ice Cube,Cuz everyday different fools try to get with me
47869,Ice Cube,For no more than a color or territory
47870,Ice Cube,Cant rehabilitate em thats the sheriffs story
47871,Ice Cube,So whats left the judge goes deaf
47872,Ice Cube,When you try to tell your side
47873,Ice Cube,Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin
47874,Ice Cube,And just hand your car keys over to your woman
47875,Ice Cube,Because it aint no sunshine where you headed
47876,Ice Cube,And the shitll drive you crazy if you let it
47877,Ice Cube,But now I got time to think
47878,Ice Cube,Because they hit me with everything but the kitchen sink
47879,Ice Cube,And I aint even shed a tear
47880,Ice Cube,Cuz believe it or not they got more love for me here
47881,Ice Cube,Now picture that but on a black and white photograph
47882,Ice Cube,Cuz brothas you dont know the half
47883,Ice Cube,On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
47884,Ice Cube,But ever since Ive been down
47885,Ice Cube,Now heres the game plan yo at a quarter to nine
47886,Ice Cube,I was told to peel a cap on the other side
47887,Ice Cube,Yo Young and dumb and full of cum I m a baby loc
47888,Ice Cube,I gotta put in work for the hood and that aint no joke
47889,Ice Cube,Stable and able but Im not ready and willin

47893,Ice Cube,Yo spotted the enemies now Im on a creep tip
47894,Ice Cube,Hit the  dollar stick and I put in my clip
47895,Ice Cube,So I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
47896,Ice Cube,I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross
47897,Ice Cube,Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
47898,Ice Cube,Thinkin should I peel his cap or should I let him survive
47899,Ice Cube,Yo Im trapped in the plan designed by another side
47900,Ice Cube,I aint contributin to genocide  why  
47901,Ice Cube,Niggas in the hood aint changed
47902,Ice Cube,And Ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang
47903,Ice Cube,Cuz I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
47904,Ice Cube,Every which way I get burned 
47905,Ice Cube,Baby Lou wears blue Big Fred wears red
47906,Ice Cube,Put em together and we color em dead
47907,Ice Cube,Dead dyin gettin smokeds like part of the fun
47908,Ice Cube,They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral
47909,Ice Cube,I understand how all my homeboys feel
47910,Ice Cube,Cuz I been shot to this day I pack my steel
47911,Ice Cube,Cuz I was born in a certain territory
47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep
47915,Ice Cube,Cuz me and T bone we pay it no mind
47916,Ice Cube,And for the rest of the mob we stay color blind
47917,Ice Cube,The army is the only way out for a young black teenager
47918,Ice Cube,Well provide you with housing
47919,Ice Cube,Well provide you with education 
47920,Ice Cube,Well provide you with everything you need to survive in life Well help you to be the best soldier in the U S of A
47921,Ice Cube,Because we do more before  A M than most niggers do in their whole lifetime
47922,Ice Cube,I wanna kill him cause he tried to play me like the trick

47924,Ice Cube,I got the A to the motherfuckin K and its ready to rip
47925,Ice Cube,Is he in Watts Oakland Philly or Brooklyn 
47926,Ice Cube,It seems like he got the whole country behind him
47927,Ice Cube,So its sort of hard to find him
47928,Ice Cube,But when I do gotta put my gat in his mouth
47929,Ice Cube,Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
47930,Ice Cube,Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
