55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
55301,J Cole,Thats the way I wished my family lived
55302,J Cole,But my granny crib was in the jects 
55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only
55313,J Cole,Dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro

56320,J Cole,When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
56321,J Cole,Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
56323,J Cole,Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
56324,J Cole,Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he

56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him

56329,J Cole,Into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
56330,J Cole,Maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas

56352,J Cole,I write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
56353,J Cole,But in a sense I can relate the need to be great
56354,J Cole,Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
56355,J Cole,Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me 
56359,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

56366,J Cole,Bout who they are and why they do this
56367,J Cole,Guess Im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
56368,J Cole,My highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
56369,J Cole,Ive seen in my life I be fiendin to write
56370,J Cole,Songs that raise the hair on my arms
56371,J Cole,My lowest moments came from tryin too hard
56372,J Cole,To impress some niggas that couldnt care if Im on
56373,J Cole,Therefore from here on out my hair grow out
56374,J Cole,I care nothin bout opinions

68987,Kanye West,I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to   
68994,Kanye West,   Newark New Jersey I hadnt even seen my apartment I remember I pulled up   
68995,Kanye West,   I unpacked all my shit You know we went to Ikea I bought a bed I put the bed together myself I loaded up all my equipment and the first beat I made was uh  Heart of the City  And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline it was Beans birthday matter of fact and I played like seven beats And you know I guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted I had did  Nothing Like It already at that time but then Jay walked in I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on I remember it like like it was yesterday And Hiphop said  Yo play that one beat for him  And I played  Heart of the City  And really I made  Heart of the City  I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
68996,Kanye West,And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that Gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like  Yo whats up Im Kanye  
68997,Kanye West, You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay Yo this nigga got classics to your beats 
68998,Kanye West,You know I aint talkin shit Im like  oh shit  And all this time Im starstruck man Im still thinking bout you know Im picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching Im lookin these were superstars in my eyes And they still are you know So Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days   I gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track I remember Lenny S he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on he think he fly And Hip Hop was there I think Ty Ty John Meneilly a bunch of people I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and I said  yo Jay I could rap  And I spit this rap that said uh  Im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips  And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line But you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response He said  man that was tight  
68999,Kanye West,That was it You know I aint get no deal then hehe Okay fast forward So Blueprint  H to the Izzo  my first hit single And I just took that proudly built relationships with people My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper Because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him Man I appre  I love him for that And at this time you know I didnt have a deal I had songs and I had relationships with all these A Rs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up Id play them some beats  Gimme a beat that sound like JayZ  You know they dick riders Whatever So Ill play them these post Blueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit Ill be like  yo but I rap too  Hey I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever Everybody out there listen here I played them Jesus Walks and they didnt sign me You know what happened it was some A Rs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say  naw  Like Dave Lighty fucked with me my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels Jessica Rivera man   
69000,Kanye West,Im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

69002,Kanye West,Dame was like  Yo you got a deal with Capitol Okay man just make sure its not wack  
69003,Kanye West,Then one day I just went ahead and played it I wanted to play some songs cause you know Cam was in the room Young Guru and Dame was in the room So I played   actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe I might use it So its called Wow

69009,Kanye West,Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like  yo man B B you dont want a brick you dont want a brick 
69010,Kanye West, You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on  I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all  oh word  Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with  H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me  oh hes just a producer rapper  and told  H that told the heads of the Capitol and right  the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do Man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said  yo   Capitol pulled on the deal 
69011,Kanye West,And you know I told them that Roc A Fella was interested and I dont know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever I went up   I called G I said  man you think we could still get that deal with Roc A Fella
