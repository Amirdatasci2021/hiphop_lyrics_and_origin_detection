104839,Pusha-T,A thousand kilos cross his lines that you cant ignore
104840,Pusha-T,I felt entitled to it not how the bible do it
104841,Pusha-T,My bright eyes exposed to how the hood idols do it
104842,Pusha-T,I just took a page then I took the stage
104843,Pusha-T,Then put the face of that Rollie in that diamond cage
104844,Pusha-T,I tried to tame the beast best I could no leash
104845,Pusha-T,I stood the test of time air tight no leaks
104846,Pusha-T,Not a squeak not a peep of a word
104847,Pusha-T,I done lived half my life in arms reach of a bird
104848,Pusha-T,Have mercy on me they put curses on me
104849,Pusha-T,I couldve been six feet or had nurses on me
104850,Pusha-T,It was written like these tatted Bible verses on me
104851,Pusha-T,I feel the weight upon my shoulders like the church is on me
104852,Pusha-T,You dont do all the shit that I done and make it through and not be forgiven
104853,Pusha-T,This is the Wrath of Caine motherfuckers
104854,Pusha-T,My Name is My name coming soon
