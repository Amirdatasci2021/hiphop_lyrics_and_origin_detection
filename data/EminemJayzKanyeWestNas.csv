39514,Eminem,It goes Reggie JayZ  Pac and Biggie
39515,Eminem,Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me

39534,Eminem,But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
39535,Eminem,If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
39536,Eminem, Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse

39538,Eminem,My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
39539,Eminem,I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
39540,Eminem,But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
39541,Eminem,The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
39542,Eminem,So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin at em
39543,Eminem,The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static 
39544,Eminem, Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters

39947,Eminem,And at the time every house that we lived in
39948,Eminem,Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
39949,Eminem,And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
39950,Eminem,Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
39951,Eminem,Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
39952,Eminem,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
39953,Eminem,And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart

39955,Eminem,On to Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
39956,Eminem,And Dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
39957,Eminem,And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
39958,Eminem,And met Dr Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
39959,Eminem,But Daddy had to work you and Momma had to leave me
39960,Eminem,Then you started seein Daddy on the TV and Momma didnt like it
39961,Eminem,And you and Lainie were too young to understand it

39963,Eminem,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
39964,Eminem,Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

40004,Eminem,Im starting to feel distant again
40005,Eminem,So I decided just to pick this pen
40006,Eminem,Up and try to make an attempt to vent
40007,Eminem,But I just cant admit or come to grips with the fact
40008,Eminem,That I may be done with rap I need a new outlet
40009,Eminem,And I know some shits so hard to swallow
40010,Eminem,But I just cant sit back and wallow

40118,Eminem,Thinkin he can try and solve em
40119,Eminem,Im outside chalkin up drawings
40120,Eminem,On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin

40135,Eminem,I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
40136,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
40137,Eminem, Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind bogglin
40138,Eminem, Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit

40151,Eminem,What about them rhymes Ive been jottin 
40152,Eminem,They are kind of giving me confidence
40153,Eminem,Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
40154,Eminem,Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx 
40155,Eminem,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that

40233,Eminem,But I think Im still tryin to figure this crap out
40234,Eminem,Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
40235,Eminem,This fuckin black cloud still follows me around
40236,Eminem,But its time to exorcise these demons

40251,Eminem,It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
40252,Eminem,Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
40253,Eminem,So I could come back a brand new me
40254,Eminem,And dont even realize what you did believe me you
40255,Eminem,Ive been through the wringer
40256,Eminem,But they can do little to the middle finger
40257,Eminem,I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
40258,Eminem,My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
40259,Eminem,And drop dead no more beef lingers
40260,Eminem,No more drama from now on I promise
40261,Eminem,To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
40262,Eminem,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
40265,Eminem,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
40266,Eminem,Id shoot for the moon but Im too busy gazin at stars
40267,Eminem,I m not afraid  I m not afraid

40273,Eminem,Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road
40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40376,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40377,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40378,Eminem,Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for

40680,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40681,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
40709,Eminem,This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
40710,Eminem,Im still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute  cause 
40711,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
40733,Eminem,But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
40734,Eminem,That we just inherited   s beef with Murder Inc

40736,Eminem,We still have soldiers thats on the front line
40737,Eminem,Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
40738,Eminem,Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
40748,Eminem,Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
40749,Eminem,Off at your jaws well then I can  cause frankly Im sick of talkin

41198,Eminem,Is more than twice than a black life span
41199,Eminem,I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
41200,Eminem,I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
41201,Eminem,Id rather hear em say  Die N word than Die Antwoord
41202,Eminem,Ninja now its better disguised banter
41203,Eminem,But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
41204,Eminem,Were applying but McDonalds
41205,Eminem,Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
41206,Eminem,So how can we have higher standards 
41207,Eminem,As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
41208,Eminem,We fight back with violence but acts like that are
41209,Eminem,Black eyes on the movement
41210,Eminem,Which makes black lives madder
41211,Eminem,Thats why its at a stalemate
41212,Eminem,And cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops
41213,Eminem,I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
41214,Eminem,The block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
41215,Eminem,Call the attack dogs off of us man
41216,Eminem,You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop

41220,Eminem,Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns
41221,Eminem,And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
41222,Eminem,And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
41223,Eminem,Wait why are there black neighborhoods 
41224,Eminem,Cause America segregated us designated us to an area
41225,Eminem,Separated us Section Eightd us
41226,Eminem,When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
41227,Eminem,And education sucks and every days another
41228,Eminem,Freddie Gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
41229,Eminem,Why is it they treat us like dryer lint 
41230,Eminem,We just want a safe environment for our kids
41231,Eminem,But can t escape the sirens
41232,Eminem,Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
41233,Eminem,The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
41234,Eminem,The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
41235,Eminem,And we re trapped in these racial biases
41236,Eminem,That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
41237,Eminem,Every time we see a devil s face
41238,Eminem,Lions tigers and bears oh my
41239,Eminem,Its more like billy clubs and gats
41240,Eminem,And we really love it when you think we re guilty  cause we re black
41241,Eminem, But you kill each other facts
41242,Eminem,You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats 
41243,Eminem,Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
41244,Eminem,While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
41245,Eminem,Fuck your Republican views
41246,Eminem,Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots 
41247,Eminem,And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
41248,Eminem,Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
41249,Eminem,You better be strapped with a derringer
41250,Eminem,Or be  capped in America like Steve Rogers
41251,Eminem,Cause no one oversees these cops and
41252,Eminem,All we see is em beat charges
41253,Eminem,We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
41254,Eminem,So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
41255,Eminem,Just keep marchin til we reach congress
41256,Eminem,But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
41257,Eminem,If you try to slander the flag but
41258,Eminem,Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
41259,Eminem,So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
41260,Eminem,If you dont stand for the national anthem
41261,Eminem,We raise it you better praise it
41262,Eminem,Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
41263,Eminem,Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
41264,Eminem,Home of the brave is still racist ville
41265,Eminem,So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
41266,Eminem,In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
41267,Eminem,That had its Natives killed
41268,Eminem,Got you singin this star spangled spiel

68980,Kanye West,Just askin me to send him beats and Im thinking hes trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named Just Blaze he was messin with
68981,Kanye West,So wont you raise your glass wont you
68982,Kanye West,So wont you raise your glass wont you
68983,Kanye West,So wont you raise your glass wont you
68984,Kanye West,So wont you raise your glass wont you
68985,Kanye West,And um he was friends with my mentor No ID And No ID told him  Look man you wanna mess with Kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap 
68986,Kanye West,No ID  Yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap 
68987,Kanye West,I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to   
68994,Kanye West,   Newark New Jersey I hadnt even seen my apartment I remember I pulled up   
68995,Kanye West,   I unpacked all my shit You know we went to Ikea I bought a bed I put the bed together myself I loaded up all my equipment and the first beat I made was uh  Heart of the City  And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline it was Beans birthday matter of fact and I played like seven beats And you know I guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted I had did  Nothing Like It already at that time but then Jay walked in I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on I remember it like like it was yesterday And Hiphop said  Yo play that one beat for him  And I played  Heart of the City  And really I made  Heart of the City  I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
68996,Kanye West,And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that Gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like  Yo whats up Im Kanye  
68997,Kanye West, You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay Yo this nigga got classics to your beats 
68998,Kanye West,You know I aint talkin shit Im like  oh shit  And all this time Im starstruck man Im still thinking bout you know Im picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching Im lookin these were superstars in my eyes And they still are you know So Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days   I gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track I remember Lenny S he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on he think he fly And Hip Hop was there I think Ty Ty John Meneilly a bunch of people I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and I said  yo Jay I could rap  And I spit this rap that said uh  Im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips  And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line But you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response He said  man that was tight  
68999,Kanye West,That was it You know I aint get no deal then hehe Okay fast forward So Blueprint  H to the Izzo  my first hit single And I just took that proudly built relationships with people My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper Because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him Man I appre  I love him for that And at this time you know I didnt have a deal I had songs and I had relationships with all these A Rs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up Id play them some beats  Gimme a beat that sound like JayZ  You know they dick riders Whatever So Ill play them these post Blueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit Ill be like  yo but I rap too  Hey I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever Everybody out there listen here I played them Jesus Walks and they didnt sign me You know what happened it was some A Rs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say  naw  Like Dave Lighty fucked with me my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels Jessica Rivera man   
69000,Kanye West,Im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up
69001,Kanye West,Lets just say I didnt get my deal The nigga that was behind me I mean he wasnt even a nigga you know The person who actually kicked everything off was Joe  H from Capitol Records He wanted to sign me really bad
69002,Kanye West,Dame was like  Yo you got a deal with Capitol Okay man just make sure its not wack  
69003,Kanye West,Then one day I just went ahead and played it I wanted to play some songs cause you know Cam was in the room Young Guru and Dame was in the room So I played   actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe I might use it So its called Wow

69008,Kanye West, I aint gonna front its kinda hot  
69009,Kanye West,Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like  yo man B B you dont want a brick you dont want a brick 
69010,Kanye West, You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on  I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all  oh word  Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with  H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me  oh hes just a producer rapper  and told  H that told the heads of the Capitol and right  the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do Man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said  yo   Capitol pulled on the deal 
69011,Kanye West,And you know I told them that Roc A Fella was interested and I dont know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever I went up   I called G I said  man you think we could still get that deal with Roc A Fella
