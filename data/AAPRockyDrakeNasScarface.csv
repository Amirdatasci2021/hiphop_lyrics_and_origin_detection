109962,Scarface,That they keep us in the dark know they act
109963,Scarface,We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap
109964,Scarface,Thought religion was the answer but the answer wasnt that

109988,Scarface,What it feels like wishing I could die and just end the pain
109989,Scarface,Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
109997,Scarface,I woke up from a dream feeling all good
109998,Scarface,Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
109999,Scarface,Lost stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out
110000,Scarface,Hustling for tennis shoe paper never panned out
110001,Scarface,My sister tripping got my grandmother stressing
110002,Scarface,Cause shes only   and shes already pregnant
110003,Scarface,Another segment of them ghetto soap operas
110004,Scarface,Bgs is tripping aint nothing left to stop them
110005,Scarface,Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mammas
110006,Scarface,Cant teach them how to be men grow up being followers
110007,Scarface,The streets swallow them then life overpower them
110008,Scarface,Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
110009,Scarface,Crash tested a dummy high volume
110010,Scarface,Only God can judge but yall niggas is comical
110011,Scarface,  percent of our futures off in prison
110012,Scarface,Prescription for my mental exorcism
110013,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
110014,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110015,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
110016,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

110021,Scarface,I dont wanna hear the preacher preach that shit a lie
110022,Scarface,Plus he knowing how that evil be but who am I
110023,Scarface,To judge a man when I see him try

110026,Scarface,In cold blood our lil homies dying
110027,Scarface,Another sign of the times but its terrifying
110028,Scarface,That you could kill us off have us outlined in chalk

110727,Scarface,And everyday we face to face with death
110728,Scarface,I seen my homies go and come
110729,Scarface,And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from
110730,Scarface,So I know my numbers comin up
110731,Scarface,So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin up
110732,Scarface,And even though I hate killin off my own kind
110733,Scarface,I gotta be a man and as a man Im a defend mine
110734,Scarface,My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
110735,Scarface,Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
110736,Scarface,So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
110737,Scarface,Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit
110738,Scarface,And the cops is in the same vote
110739,Scarface,Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
110740,Scarface,They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
110741,Scarface,They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
110742,Scarface,And now the storys all twisted up
110743,Scarface,And if they gave the cop the chair
110744,Scarface,I really wouldnt give a fuck
110745,Scarface,Because she left my partners family with memories
110746,Scarface,And after hearin this I know you gon remember me
110747,Scarface,But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
110748,Scarface,I see his parents and then I started breakin up
110749,Scarface,Because I know what you did was wrong
110750,Scarface,But you wont realize until you dead and gone
110751,Scarface,It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
110752,Scarface,You straight up shot him from behind
110753,Scarface,But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
110758,Scarface,Then in reality you took care of your business
110759,Scarface,But regardless I know you wanna kill me
110760,Scarface,But I aint goin out like dat

110778,Scarface,Cause the homies that I thought I had
110779,Scarface,And they just started talkin bad
110780,Scarface,So I stay away from outsiders

110791,Scarface,So I take it on myself to thank him one deep
110792,Scarface,And give my money to the most needy
110793,Scarface,And never put it in the hands of the most greedy
110794,Scarface,Cause their puttin a price tag on a mans word
110795,Scarface,And its a fashion show so the men flirt
110796,Scarface,The world is endin so they try to make us switch fast
110797,Scarface,And they openin up these churches for some quick cash

111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
