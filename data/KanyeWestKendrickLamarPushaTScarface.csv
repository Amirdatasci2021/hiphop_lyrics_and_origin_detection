68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to

71245,Kendrick Lamar,It s actually something a good friend had wrote
71246,Kendrick Lamar,Describing my world it says 
71247,Kendrick Lamar, The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
71248,Kendrick Lamar,Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
71249,Kendrick Lamar,In order to protect itself from this mad city
71250,Kendrick Lamar,While consuming its environment
71251,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
71252,Kendrick Lamar,One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
71258,Kendrick Lamar,Already surrounded by this mad city
71259,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
71260,Kendrick Lamar,Which institutionalizes him
71261,Kendrick Lamar,He can no longer see past his own thoughts
71262,Kendrick Lamar,When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
71263,Kendrick Lamar,Going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
71264,Kendrick Lamar,Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
71265,Kendrick Lamar,Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
71266,Kendrick Lamar,That the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
71267,Kendrick Lamar,Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
71268,Kendrick Lamar,They are one and the same 
71269,Kendrick Lamar,What s your perspective on that

72992,Kendrick Lamar,Called West Side Compton there stood a little nigga
72993,Kendrick Lamar,He was five foot something dazed and confused
72994,Kendrick Lamar,Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
72995,Kendrick Lamar,You can take your boy out the hood but you cant take the hood out the homie
72996,Kendrick Lamar,Took his show money stashed it in the mozey wozey
72997,Kendrick Lamar,Fuck you goodnight thank you much for your service
72998,Kendrick Lamar,Want to reconnect with your elations 
72999,Kendrick Lamar,Look inside these walls and you see Im havin withdrawals
73000,Kendrick Lamar,Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
73001,Kendrick Lamar,Track attire just tell you Im tired and ran away
73002,Kendrick Lamar,I should ask a choir  What do you require
73003,Kendrick Lamar,To sing a song that acquire me to have faith  
73004,Kendrick Lamar,As the record spin I should pray
73005,Kendrick Lamar,For the record I recognize that Im easily prey
73006,Kendrick Lamar,I got animosity buildin its probly big as a buildin
73007,Kendrick Lamar,Me jumpin off of the roof is me just playin it safe
73008,Kendrick Lamar,But what am I posed to do when the topic is red or blue
73009,Kendrick Lamar,And you understand that I aint
73010,Kendrick Lamar,But know Im accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
73011,Kendrick Lamar,And live in the street with rank
73012,Kendrick Lamar,No better picture to paint than me walkin from bible study
73013,Kendrick Lamar,And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
73014,Kendrick Lamar,From a function that tooken place they was wonderin if I bang
73015,Kendrick Lamar,Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
73016,Kendrick Lamar,I dont mind cause one day youll respect
73017,Kendrick Lamar,Want to reconnect with your elations 
73018,Kendrick Lamar,All I see is strobe lights blindin me in my hindsight
73019,Kendrick Lamar,Findin me by myself promise me you can help
73020,Kendrick Lamar,In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until
73021,Kendrick Lamar,You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
73022,Kendrick Lamar,It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still
73023,Kendrick Lamar,I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
73024,Kendrick Lamar,Every time you clock in the morning I feel you just want to kill
73025,Kendrick Lamar,All my innocence while ignorin my purpose to persevere
73026,Kendrick Lamar,As a better person I know you heard this and probably in fear
73027,Kendrick Lamar,But what am I posed to do when the blinkin of red and blue
73028,Kendrick Lamar,Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
73029,Kendrick Lamar,And you ask  Lift up your shirt  because you wonder if a tattoo
73030,Kendrick Lamar,Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
73031,Kendrick Lamar,Gang files but that dont matter because the matter is racial profile
73032,Kendrick Lamar,I heard em chatter  Hes probly young but I know that hes down
73033,Kendrick Lamar,Step on his neck as hard as your bullet proof vest
73034,Kendrick Lamar,He dont mind he know well never respect
73035,Kendrick Lamar,The good kid m A A d city  
73036,Kendrick Lamar,Want to reconnect with your elations 
73037,Kendrick Lamar,All I see in this room   s Xannies and these shrooms
73038,Kendrick Lamar,Grown up candy for pain can we live in a sane
73039,Kendrick Lamar,Society Its entirely stressful upon my brain
73040,Kendrick Lamar,You hired me as a victim I quietly hope for change
73041,Kendrick Lamar,When violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
73042,Kendrick Lamar,The silence in this room with   s Xannies and shrooms
73043,Kendrick Lamar,Some grown up candy I lost it I feel its nothin to lose
73044,Kendrick Lamar,The streets sure to release the worst side of my best
73045,Kendrick Lamar,Dont mind cause now you ever in debt to good kid m A A d city
73046,Kendrick Lamar,Want to reconnect with your elations

111954,Scarface, It aint no muthafuckin peace when they see me 
111955,Scarface,Cause we never had a muthafuckin peace treaty
111956,Scarface,So I know I got to get em with game
111957,Scarface,And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
111958,Scarface,Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
111959,Scarface,And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
111960,Scarface,I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
111961,Scarface,Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
111962,Scarface,And thats the one that can close the shop
111963,Scarface,So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
111964,Scarface,Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
111965,Scarface,But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see 
111966,Scarface,I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
111967,Scarface,But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
111968,Scarface,And the nigga that tried to pull it
111969,Scarface,If I dont get lean and blowed everyday
111970,Scarface,I feel just like Imma explode on overload and overdrive
111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
111978,Scarface,But to tell the truth I didnt know myself
111979,Scarface,I found out she had to told me
111980,Scarface,Just to show me just how good I had it
111981,Scarface,Mild mannered I just couldnt be it
111982,Scarface,But that was just the way we used to G it
111983,Scarface,One of the wrongest niggas I see
111984,Scarface,Or one of the strongest niggas I know
111985,Scarface,Walkin on my tippy toe cause the life I live aint long and I know
111986,Scarface,So I put weed in the bong and I blow
111987,Scarface,Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
111988,Scarface,Child that grew into a man thats widely respected
111989,Scarface,But that dont stop our pain
111990,Scarface,Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
111991,Scarface,I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
111992,Scarface,These bitch ass niggas shife
111993,Scarface,Niggas might snitch out they momma
111994,Scarface,Thats why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama

111998,Scarface,At night I talk to God and try to understand
111999,Scarface,How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
112000,Scarface,I guess they already gone aint nothin gone bring them back
112001,Scarface,So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
112002,Scarface,I still love my piece and chain wood grain and big head ones
112003,Scarface,But I had to realize in life everything aint always fun
112004,Scarface,I guess thats true for some

113130,Scarface,And I crawled out of the house Army style with the rifle cradled in both arms
113131,Scarface,Alright I said just hold it right there I said dont move
113132,Scarface,And I walked up on him with the shotgun
113133,Scarface,And I cocked both barrels of the shotgun on him cause I had double oughts in it
