11411,Big L,Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
11412,Big L,Flamboyant is the label Im with motherfucker
11413,Big L,There are too many MCs who are overrated
11414,Big L,You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
11415,Big L,In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
11416,Big L,So give it up become a actor or a actress
11417,Big L,Or a producer cause you fail to use the
11418,Big L,Mic right so take flight before I bruise ya
11419,Big L,For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
11420,Big L,You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
11421,Big L,Hey yo Im serious Big L aint playin games
11422,Big L,I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names
11423,Big L,But deep down inside you know who you are
11424,Big L,Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
11425,Big L,And that really gets on my nerve
11426,Big L,When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
11427,Big L,Goin platinum and dont have no soul
11428,Big L,Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
11429,Big L,I dont like the way its goin down
11430,Big L,Because it should be the other way around
11431,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11432,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11433,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11434,Big L,How MCs take this rap game for granted
11435,Big L,I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
11436,Big L,One minute youre hardcore and raw
11437,Big L,Thats what you was known for but not no more
11438,Big L,You changed you rearranged
11439,Big L,Youre not the same your raps are plain
11440,Big L,That explain why you lost your fame
11441,Big L,Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
11442,Big L,You turned pop now you no longer gain props
11443,Big L,Whos fault is that Nobodys but your own black
11444,Big L,Used to make fat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
11445,Big L,So MCs dont ever step out your range
11446,Big L,And only change with the time
11447,Big L,Unless you get dropped like a dime
11448,Big L,Go for yours like Im goin for mine
11449,Big L,But if youre rough stay rough if youre dap stay dapper
11450,Big L,And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
11451,Big L,Just fulfill your own needs
11452,Big L,Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads 
11453,Big L,This is how it should be done
11454,Big L,Im not the one and my raps is strong like rum
11455,Big L,But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb
11456,Big L,Plus slum  How come  Rap skills they have none
11457,Big L,And I wonder how the hell they records sell
11458,Big L,They raps are stale and frail
11459,Big L,Theyre false like fairy tales
11460,Big L,Your technique and everything you speaks weak
11461,Big L,You got a little airplay because of your beats
11462,Big L,Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
11463,Big L,Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
11464,Big L,Your raps border wack and you went on tour with that
11465,Big L,Crap dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
11466,Big L,I got more soul that Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
11467,Big L,Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs
11468,Big L,But still call themselves MCs
11469,Big L,Some people was born in heaven
11470,Big L,With a silver spoon in they mouth
11471,Big L,And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
11472,Big L,And never had to work hard for nothing
11473,Big L,Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
11474,Big L,Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
11475,Big L,And had to work hard for everything they got
11476,Big L,And never had nothing handed to them   and never will
11477,Big L,And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
11478,Big L,Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
11479,Big L,My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
11480,Big L,Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
11481,Big L,Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
11482,Big L,Too ashamed to walk the streets
11483,Big L,Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
11484,Big L,Even my holidays got damaged
11485,Big L,Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
11486,Big L,And every day I ask myself  How will I make it  
11487,Big L,It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
11488,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11489,Big L,I walk around with a frown I got no reason to smile
11490,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11491,Big L,Aiyo times was rough I had to grow up foul
11492,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11493,Big L,I always knew that Id end up doing time on the Isle
11494,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11495,Big L,Five years passed by now Im at the age of

11499,Big L,Soon I ran into a couple of guns

11501,Big L,Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
11502,Big L,I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
11503,Big L,Then I lost control and started going too far
11504,Big L,Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
11505,Big L,Where I grew up it was a living Hell
11506,Big L,Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
11507,Big L,Now I can sleep now I can eat
11508,Big L,Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
11509,Big L,And every day I ask myself How will I make it 
11510,Big L,Doing time was full of stress G
11511,Big L,All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
11512,Big L,One tried to test me didnt find it humorous
11513,Big L,Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
11514,Big L,My time came to a cease Im back on the streets again

11520,Big L,My whole life was deserted
11521,Big L,Either Ima go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it 
11522,Big L,All I tried to do was live the one life that I got

55226,J Cole,Now I see death around the corner pologizing in advance
55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions

55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass

55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled

56320,J Cole,When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately

56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
56323,J Cole,Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
56324,J Cole,Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he

56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him

56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me 
56359,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

57930,J Cole,I used to think it was to overthrow oppressors see
57931,J Cole,If we destroy the system that means well have less of greed

57933,J Cole,I got to thinkin about the history of human nature
57934,J Cole,While this instrumental played
57935,J Cole,Then I realized somethin that made
57936,J Cole,Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
57937,J Cole,Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
57938,J Cole,Think about this shit for a second you heard the way
57939,J Cole,The children in abusive households grow up
57940,J Cole,Knockin girlfriends out cold thats called a cycle
57941,J Cole,Abused becomes the abuser and thats just how life go
57942,J Cole,You get the power but you know what power does to man 
57943,J Cole,Corruption always leads us to the same shit again

68979,Kanye West,Uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth

68986,Kanye West,No ID  Yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap 
68987,Kanye West,I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to   
68994,Kanye West,   Newark New Jersey I hadnt even seen my apartment I remember I pulled up   
68995,Kanye West,   I unpacked all my shit You know we went to Ikea I bought a bed I put the bed together myself I loaded up all my equipment and the first beat I made was uh  Heart of the City  And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline it was Beans birthday matter of fact and I played like seven beats And you know I guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted I had did  Nothing Like It already at that time but then Jay walked in I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on I remember it like like it was yesterday And Hiphop said  Yo play that one beat for him  And I played  Heart of the City  And really I made  Heart of the City  I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
68996,Kanye West,And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that Gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like  Yo whats up Im Kanye  
68997,Kanye West, You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay Yo this nigga got classics to your beats 
68998,Kanye West,You know I aint talkin shit Im like  oh shit  And all this time Im starstruck man Im still thinking bout you know Im picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching Im lookin these were superstars in my eyes And they still are you know So Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days   I gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track I remember Lenny S he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on he think he fly And Hip Hop was there I think Ty Ty John Meneilly a bunch of people I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and I said  yo Jay I could rap  And I spit this rap that said uh  Im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips  And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line But you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response He said  man that was tight  
68999,Kanye West,That was it You know I aint get no deal then hehe Okay fast forward So Blueprint  H to the Izzo  my first hit single And I just took that proudly built relationships with people My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper Because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him Man I appre  I love him for that And at this time you know I didnt have a deal I had songs and I had relationships with all these A Rs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up Id play them some beats  Gimme a beat that sound like JayZ  You know they dick riders Whatever So Ill play them these post Blueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit Ill be like  yo but I rap too  Hey I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever Everybody out there listen here I played them Jesus Walks and they didnt sign me You know what happened it was some A Rs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say  naw  Like Dave Lighty fucked with me my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels Jessica Rivera man   
69000,Kanye West,Im not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up

69002,Kanye West,Dame was like  Yo you got a deal with Capitol Okay man just make sure its not wack  
69003,Kanye West,Then one day I just went ahead and played it I wanted to play some songs cause you know Cam was in the room Young Guru and Dame was in the room So I played   actually its a song that youll never hear but maybe I might use it So its called Wow

69009,Kanye West,Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like  yo man B B you dont want a brick you dont want a brick 
69010,Kanye West, You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on  I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all  oh word  Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with  H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me  oh hes just a producer rapper  and told  H that told the heads of the Capitol and right  the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do Man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said  yo   Capitol pulled on the deal 
69011,Kanye West,And you know I told them that Roc A Fella was interested and I dont know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever I went up   I called G I said  man you think we could still get that deal with Roc A Fella
