11413,Big L,There are too many MCs who are overrated
11414,Big L,You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
11415,Big L,In the rap biz they dont know what rap is

11431,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11432,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11433,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11434,Big L,How MCs take this rap game for granted
11435,Big L,I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
11436,Big L,One minute youre hardcore and raw
11437,Big L,Thats what you was known for but not no more
11438,Big L,You changed you rearranged
11439,Big L,Youre not the same your raps are plain

11443,Big L,Whos fault is that Nobodys but your own black
11444,Big L,Used to make fat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
11445,Big L,So MCs dont ever step out your range
11446,Big L,And only change with the time
11447,Big L,Unless you get dropped like a dime
11448,Big L,Go for yours like Im goin for mine
11449,Big L,But if youre rough stay rough if youre dap stay dapper
11450,Big L,And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
11451,Big L,Just fulfill your own needs
11452,Big L,Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads 
11453,Big L,This is how it should be done
11454,Big L,Im not the one and my raps is strong like rum
11455,Big L,But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb
11456,Big L,Plus slum  How come  Rap skills they have none
11457,Big L,And I wonder how the hell they records sell
11458,Big L,They raps are stale and frail
11459,Big L,Theyre false like fairy tales
11460,Big L,Your technique and everything you speaks weak
11461,Big L,You got a little airplay because of your beats
11462,Big L,Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
11463,Big L,Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
11464,Big L,Your raps border wack and you went on tour with that
11465,Big L,Crap dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack

11470,Big L,With a silver spoon in they mouth
11471,Big L,And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
11472,Big L,And never had to work hard for nothing
11473,Big L,Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
11474,Big L,Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
11475,Big L,And had to work hard for everything they got
11476,Big L,And never had nothing handed to them   and never will
11477,Big L,And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
11478,Big L,Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
11479,Big L,My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
11480,Big L,Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
11481,Big L,Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
11482,Big L,Too ashamed to walk the streets
11483,Big L,Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
11484,Big L,Even my holidays got damaged
11485,Big L,Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
11486,Big L,And every day I ask myself  How will I make it  
11487,Big L,It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
11488,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how

11499,Big L,Soon I ran into a couple of guns

11501,Big L,Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
11502,Big L,I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
11503,Big L,Then I lost control and started going too far
11504,Big L,Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
11505,Big L,Where I grew up it was a living Hell
11506,Big L,Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
11507,Big L,Now I can sleep now I can eat
11508,Big L,Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
11509,Big L,And every day I ask myself How will I make it 
11510,Big L,Doing time was full of stress G

70510,Kendrick Lamar,Back to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
70511,Kendrick Lamar,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
70512,Kendrick Lamar,Or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
70513,Kendrick Lamar,Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught

70519,Kendrick Lamar,And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song
70520,Kendrick Lamar,Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
70521,Kendrick Lamar,And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great 
70522,Kendrick Lamar,A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
70523,Kendrick Lamar,Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
70524,Kendrick Lamar,Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
70525,Kendrick Lamar,And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get it or die tryin

70538,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70539,Kendrick Lamar,Sometimes I look in the mirror
70540,Kendrick Lamar,And ask myself Am I really scared of passin away 
70541,Kendrick Lamar,If its today I hope I hear a
70542,Kendrick Lamar,Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
70543,Kendrick Lamar,With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
70544,Kendrick Lamar,I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
70545,Kendrick Lamar,The scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
70546,Kendrick Lamar,With the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
70547,Kendrick Lamar,May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
70548,Kendrick Lamar,And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
70549,Kendrick Lamar,And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
70550,Kendrick Lamar,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
70551,Kendrick Lamar,That can come about  cause the tongue is mighty powerful
70552,Kendrick Lamar,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
70553,Kendrick Lamar,Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death

71246,Kendrick Lamar,Describing my world it says 
71247,Kendrick Lamar, The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
71248,Kendrick Lamar,Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
71249,Kendrick Lamar,In order to protect itself from this mad city
71250,Kendrick Lamar,While consuming its environment
71251,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
71252,Kendrick Lamar,One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
71258,Kendrick Lamar,Already surrounded by this mad city
71259,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
71260,Kendrick Lamar,Which institutionalizes him
71261,Kendrick Lamar,He can no longer see past his own thoughts
71262,Kendrick Lamar,When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
71263,Kendrick Lamar,Going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
71264,Kendrick Lamar,Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
71265,Kendrick Lamar,Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
71266,Kendrick Lamar,That the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
71267,Kendrick Lamar,Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
71268,Kendrick Lamar,They are one and the same
