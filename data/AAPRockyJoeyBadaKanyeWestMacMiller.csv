68979,Kanye West,Uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth

68986,Kanye West,No ID  Yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap 
68987,Kanye West,I was all I dunno if he was gassin me or not but hes like he wanna manage me as a rapper AND a producer
68988,Kanye West,Im like oh shit I was messin with uh D Dot also People were like this started talking about the ghost production but thats how I got in the game If it wasnt for that I wouldnt be here So you know after they picked that  Truth beat I was figuring I was gonna do some more work but shit just wasnt poppin off like that I was stayin in Chicago I had my own apartment I be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a Pelle Pelle off lay away get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine thats what we wore back then
68989,Kanye West,I made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone hes like  Oh yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called The Dynasty And at that time like the drums really werent soundin right to me So I went and um I was listening to Dre Chronic     at that time And really I just like bit the drums off  Xxplosive and put it like with a sped up sample and now its kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on  This Cant be Life  
68990,Kanye West,And that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on The Dynasty album I could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound You know I got to come in and track the beat and at the time I was still with my other management I really wanted to roll with Hip Hop cause I I just needed some fresh air you know what Im sayin cause I been there for a while I appreciated what they did for me but you know theres a time in every mans life where he gotta make a change Try to move up to the next level And that day I came and I tracked the beat and I got to meet JayZ and he said  Oh you a real soulful dude  
68991,Kanye West,And he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time I got to the studio You know how he do it one take And he said
68992,Kanye West, Tell me what you think of this  And I heard it and I was thinking like man I really wanted more like of the simple type JayZ I aint want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the   in my personal opinion So he asked me  What you think of it  
68993,Kanye West,And I was like  Man that shit tight  you know what Im sayin man what Ima tell him I was on the train man you know So after that I went back home And man Im Im just in Chicago Im trying to do my thing You know I got groups I got acts Im trying to get on and like there wasnt nothin really like poppin off the way it should have been One of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed But it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company So like Im just straight holdin the phone gettin the bad news that dude was tryin to leave my company And I got evicted at the same time So I went down and tracked the beats from him I took that money came back packed all my shit up in a U Haul maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I aint have to deal with the landlord cause hes a jerk Me and my mother drove to   
68994,Kanye West,   Newark New Jersey I hadnt even seen my apartment I remember I pulled up   
68995,Kanye West,   I unpacked all my shit You know we went to Ikea I bought a bed I put the bed together myself I loaded up all my equipment and the first beat I made was uh  Heart of the City  And Beans was still working on his album at that time so I came up there to Baseline it was Beans birthday matter of fact and I played like seven beats And you know I guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted I had did  Nothing Like It already at that time but then Jay walked in I remember he had a Gucci bucket hat on I remember it like like it was yesterday And Hiphop said  Yo play that one beat for him  And I played  Heart of the City  And really I made  Heart of the City  I really wanted to give that beat to DMX
68996,Kanye West,And I played another beat and I played another beat And I remember that Gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like OOOOOOOOOOH Two days later Im in Baseline and I seen Dame Dame didnt know who I was and I was like  Yo whats up Im Kanye  
68997,Kanye West, You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay Yo this nigga got classics to your beats 
68998,Kanye West,You know I aint talkin shit Im like  oh shit  And all this time Im starstruck man Im still thinking bout you know Im picturing these niggas on the show The Streets is Watching Im lookin these were superstars in my eyes And they still are you know So Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days   I gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day I did the Cant be Life beat on track I remember Lenny S he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on he think he fly And Hip Hop was there I think Ty Ty John Meneilly a bunch of people I didnt know all these people at the time they was in the room and I said  yo Jay I could rap  And I spit this rap that said uh  Im killin yall niggas on that lyrical shit Mayonnaise colored Benz I push miracle whips  And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line But you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so thats all the response He said  man that was tight  
68999,Kanye West,That was it You know I aint get no deal then hehe Okay fast forward So Blueprint  H to the Izzo  my first hit single And I just took that proudly built relationships with people My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper Because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him Man I appre  I love him for that And at this time you know I didnt have a deal I had songs and I had relationships with all these A Rs and they wanted beats from me so theyd call me up Id play them some beats  Gimme a beat that sound like JayZ  You know they dick riders Whatever So Ill play them these post Blueprint beats or whatever and then Ill play my shit Ill be like  yo but I rap too  Hey I guess they was lookin at me crazy cause you know cause I aint have a jersey on or whatever Everybody out there listen here I played them Jesus Walks and they didnt sign me You know what happened it was some A Rs that fucked with me though but then like the heads itd be somebody at the company thatll say  naw  Like Dave Lighty fucked with me my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels Jessica Rivera man

69009,Kanye West,Like they still werent looking at me like a rapper And Im sure Dame figured like man If he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album you know So uh Dame took me into the office and hes like  yo man B B you dont want a brick you dont want a brick 
69010,Kanye West, You gotta be under an umbrella youll get rained on  I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all  oh word  Actually even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with  H That you know cause I told him I was gonna do it and Im a man of my word I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do Then you know Im not gonna name no names but people told me  oh hes just a producer rapper  and told  H that told the heads of the Capitol and right  the day Im talking about I planned out everything I was gonna do Man I had picked out clothes I already started booking studio sessions I started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man I was ready to go And they had Mel call me they said  yo   Capitol pulled on the deal
