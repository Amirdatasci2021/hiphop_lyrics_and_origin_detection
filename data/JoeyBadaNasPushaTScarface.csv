110117,Scarface,They wanna learn the game from an old school
110118,Scarface,I give em strategies to sleep on
110119,Scarface,So when they put me in the grave they could keep on

110130,Scarface,And staying drunk on the regular
110131,Scarface,Talking dope talk on your cellular
110132,Scarface,But in this game thats a no no

110144,Scarface,You dont upstrap unless you have to
110145,Scarface,Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
110146,Scarface,Dig two graves just in case its two bodies

110152,Scarface,They aint your home boys not these niggas
110153,Scarface,First chance you call sleep they could murk you

110158,Scarface,Better keep your punk ass out the yard
110159,Scarface,And dont get fronted just avoid that
110160,Scarface,But if you have to pay them boys back
110161,Scarface,Cos niggas aint playing its a drought
110162,Scarface,The border is closed the cash running out
110163,Scarface,And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks

110178,Scarface,And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
110179,Scarface,The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
110180,Scarface,But once you in it its hard to get out of
110181,Scarface,And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do

111949,Scarface,To kill a nigga who aint fuckin with the gang with me
111950,Scarface,Formaldehyde smokin niggas gettin loced and
111951,Scarface,Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
111952,Scarface,Scoping hoping for you to fuck up and slip
111953,Scarface,So we can have a reason for fuckin up your shit
111954,Scarface, It aint no muthafuckin peace when they see me 
111955,Scarface,Cause we never had a muthafuckin peace treaty
111956,Scarface,So I know I got to get em with game
111957,Scarface,And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
111958,Scarface,Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
111959,Scarface,And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
111960,Scarface,I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
111961,Scarface,Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
111962,Scarface,And thats the one that can close the shop
111963,Scarface,So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
111964,Scarface,Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
111965,Scarface,But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see 
111966,Scarface,I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
111967,Scarface,But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
111968,Scarface,And the nigga that tried to pull it
111969,Scarface,If I dont get lean and blowed everyday
111970,Scarface,I feel just like Imma explode on overload and overdrive
111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
111978,Scarface,But to tell the truth I didnt know myself
111979,Scarface,I found out she had to told me
111980,Scarface,Just to show me just how good I had it
111981,Scarface,Mild mannered I just couldnt be it
111982,Scarface,But that was just the way we used to G it
111983,Scarface,One of the wrongest niggas I see
111984,Scarface,Or one of the strongest niggas I know
111985,Scarface,Walkin on my tippy toe cause the life I live aint long and I know
111986,Scarface,So I put weed in the bong and I blow
111987,Scarface,Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
111988,Scarface,Child that grew into a man thats widely respected
111989,Scarface,But that dont stop our pain
111990,Scarface,Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
111991,Scarface,I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
111992,Scarface,These bitch ass niggas shife
111993,Scarface,Niggas might snitch out they momma
111994,Scarface,Thats why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
111995,Scarface,Cause we aint promised tommorow
111996,Scarface,But nigga you promised to die
111997,Scarface,Nigga cant you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
111998,Scarface,At night I talk to God and try to understand
111999,Scarface,How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
112000,Scarface,I guess they already gone aint nothin gone bring them back
112001,Scarface,So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
112002,Scarface,I still love my piece and chain wood grain and big head ones
112003,Scarface,But I had to realize in life everything aint always fun
112004,Scarface,I guess thats true for some
112005,Scarface,But them hoes will never win
112006,Scarface,Out here just hustlin and grindin
