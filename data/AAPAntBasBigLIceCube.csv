11411,Big L,Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
11412,Big L,Flamboyant is the label Im with motherfucker
11413,Big L,There are too many MCs who are overrated
11414,Big L,You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
11415,Big L,In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
11416,Big L,So give it up become a actor or a actress
11417,Big L,Or a producer cause you fail to use the
11418,Big L,Mic right so take flight before I bruise ya
11419,Big L,For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax

11421,Big L,Hey yo Im serious Big L aint playin games
11422,Big L,I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names
11423,Big L,But deep down inside you know who you are
11424,Big L,Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
11425,Big L,And that really gets on my nerve
11426,Big L,When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
11427,Big L,Goin platinum and dont have no soul
11428,Big L,Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
11429,Big L,I dont like the way its goin down
11430,Big L,Because it should be the other way around
11431,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11432,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11433,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11434,Big L,How MCs take this rap game for granted
11435,Big L,I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
11436,Big L,One minute youre hardcore and raw
11437,Big L,Thats what you was known for but not no more
11438,Big L,You changed you rearranged
11439,Big L,Youre not the same your raps are plain
11440,Big L,That explain why you lost your fame
11441,Big L,Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
11442,Big L,You turned pop now you no longer gain props
11443,Big L,Whos fault is that Nobodys but your own black
11444,Big L,Used to make fat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
11445,Big L,So MCs dont ever step out your range
11446,Big L,And only change with the time
11447,Big L,Unless you get dropped like a dime
11448,Big L,Go for yours like Im goin for mine
11449,Big L,But if youre rough stay rough if youre dap stay dapper
11450,Big L,And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
11451,Big L,Just fulfill your own needs
11452,Big L,Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads 
11453,Big L,This is how it should be done
11454,Big L,Im not the one and my raps is strong like rum
11455,Big L,But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb
11456,Big L,Plus slum  How come  Rap skills they have none
11457,Big L,And I wonder how the hell they records sell
11458,Big L,They raps are stale and frail
11459,Big L,Theyre false like fairy tales
11460,Big L,Your technique and everything you speaks weak
11461,Big L,You got a little airplay because of your beats
11462,Big L,Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
11463,Big L,Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
11464,Big L,Your raps border wack and you went on tour with that
11465,Big L,Crap dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
11466,Big L,I got more soul that Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
11467,Big L,Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs
11468,Big L,But still call themselves MCs
11469,Big L,Some people was born in heaven
11470,Big L,With a silver spoon in they mouth
11471,Big L,And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
11472,Big L,And never had to work hard for nothing
11473,Big L,Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
11474,Big L,Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
11475,Big L,And had to work hard for everything they got
11476,Big L,And never had nothing handed to them   and never will
11477,Big L,And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
11478,Big L,Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
11479,Big L,My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
11480,Big L,Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
11481,Big L,Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
11482,Big L,Too ashamed to walk the streets
11483,Big L,Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
11484,Big L,Even my holidays got damaged
11485,Big L,Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
11486,Big L,And every day I ask myself  How will I make it  
11487,Big L,It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
11488,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11489,Big L,I walk around with a frown I got no reason to smile
11490,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11491,Big L,Aiyo times was rough I had to grow up foul
11492,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11493,Big L,I always knew that Id end up doing time on the Isle
11494,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11495,Big L,Five years passed by now Im at the age of   
11496,Big L,No more fun and games its time to get cream
11497,Big L,Cause Im about to burst its like my life was cursed
11498,Big L,I went to church prayed everyday and it still got worse
11499,Big L,Soon I ran into a couple of guns
11500,Big L,Started stalking the streets late robbing suckers for funds
11501,Big L,Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
11502,Big L,I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
11503,Big L,Then I lost control and started going too far
11504,Big L,Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
11505,Big L,Where I grew up it was a living Hell
11506,Big L,Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
11507,Big L,Now I can sleep now I can eat
11508,Big L,Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
11509,Big L,And every day I ask myself How will I make it 
11510,Big L,Doing time was full of stress G
11511,Big L,All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
11512,Big L,One tried to test me didnt find it humorous
11513,Big L,Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
11514,Big L,My time came to a cease Im back on the streets again
11515,Big L,I hope I dont get snatched by the beast again
11516,Big L,But its getting crazy hectic cause Im broke get up naked
11517,Big L,And cant get a job cause of my jail record
11518,Big L,Before you know it I was robbing them same ducks
11519,Big L,I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
11520,Big L,My whole life was deserted
11521,Big L,Either Ima go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it 
11522,Big L,All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
11523,Big L,But it seems like I cant get a fair shot
11524,Big L,And every day I ask myself How will I make it 
11525,Big L,Word up man its real rough out here man

47474,Ice Cube,How to survive in South Central  what you do  
47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive

47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep
47915,Ice Cube,Cuz me and T bone we pay it no mind
