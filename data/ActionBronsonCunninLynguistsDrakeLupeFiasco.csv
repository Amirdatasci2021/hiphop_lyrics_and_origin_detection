23932,CunninLynguists,Growth from the rain of the previous years
23933,CunninLynguists,I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears
23934,CunninLynguists,As Summers heatwaves ascended in its splendid manner
23935,CunninLynguists,Green was flooding our scene although the skin was tanner
23936,CunninLynguists, Fuck The Police   jumpin over radio scanners
23937,CunninLynguists,It was hot in the shade wet paint all over the canvas
23938,CunninLynguists,Fuck Vanilla Ice cones we had T Cubes Amerikkas Most
23939,CunninLynguists,And wanted that Chronic on the Left Coast
23940,CunninLynguists,Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
23941,CunninLynguists,Backstrokin through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
23942,CunninLynguists,Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
23943,CunninLynguists,It was  Live Florida crews caught heat for rappin
23944,CunninLynguists,But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
23945,CunninLynguists,And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
23946,CunninLynguists,The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
23947,CunninLynguists,Strictly  My Niggas that were ready to die in the ride
23948,CunninLynguists,I wish the summers vibe couldve lasted forever
23949,CunninLynguists,To bad we had to have a change in that weather that shit was beautiful
23950,CunninLynguists,Seasons Change mad things rearrange

23953,CunninLynguists,See all them leaves must fall down
23954,CunninLynguists,As the East vs West winds blew causing two
23955,CunninLynguists,Legends to Fall like maple leaves from escalated beef
23956,CunninLynguists,Assumed that the worst was over
23957,CunninLynguists,Til these cats started wearing shiny costumes like the   st of October
23958,CunninLynguists,The weathers colder but the word jacket jack it
23959,CunninLynguists,Is what they did to peoples styles
23960,CunninLynguists,Not what they covered they backs with

23978,CunninLynguists,Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
23979,CunninLynguists,And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
23980,CunninLynguists,Jolly fat white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
23981,CunninLynguists,And artists themselves get treated like Elves
23982,CunninLynguists,Matter of fact Santas gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
23983,CunninLynguists,You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
23984,CunninLynguists,What the hell You need cells and  ways for chicks to bone ya 
23985,CunninLynguists,And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia

23990,CunninLynguists,He said  Fuck sobriety death to the worker bees 
23991,CunninLynguists,Thirteen circles Ive stepped for eternity
23992,CunninLynguists,Burning purple stressed on a murder spree
23993,CunninLynguists,Its self inflicted dont get it twisted
23994,CunninLynguists,These knives in my back now Elliott Smith yeah 
23995,CunninLynguists,Rides in the background melodies fit  yeah 
23996,CunninLynguists,Mixed with the misfits fix is the hurt
23997,CunninLynguists,When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
23998,CunninLynguists,French kiss vixens distant and cursed
23999,CunninLynguists,Burned bridges occurred from scriptin my words
24000,CunninLynguists,Word so Ill chisel a verse
24001,CunninLynguists,On these lie filled halls that Ive lived in and searched
24002,CunninLynguists,Im still lost in a head of catacombs
24003,CunninLynguists,Cause I build walls like Im Edgar Allan Poe
24004,CunninLynguists,Ive killed off every damsel that I know
24005,CunninLynguists,For castles that I keep castles that I know
24006,CunninLynguists,Im having spirits in the dark laying under moonlight
24007,CunninLynguists,Laughing with a stranger like I saved her from her doomed life
24008,CunninLynguists,Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
24009,CunninLynguists,Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
24010,CunninLynguists,A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
24011,CunninLynguists,Life is like a lion and Im dying at its feet
24012,CunninLynguists,I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
24013,CunninLynguists,Ive seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B roll
24014,CunninLynguists,My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
24015,CunninLynguists,And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
24016,CunninLynguists,My memory banks the only thing I tend to rob
24017,CunninLynguists,And every time I phone the lob Im out of dodge
24018,CunninLynguists,Its hard on the boulevard and other clich s
24019,CunninLynguists,The type of bullshit that Im feeding self these days
24020,CunninLynguists,Corrosion on my relays one thing my mirrors chose
24021,CunninLynguists,An imp in new clothes exposed
24022,CunninLynguists,I mow a dead lawn aim for the alpha
24023,CunninLynguists,Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
24024,CunninLynguists,Not a man a receptacle for crest fallen matter
24025,CunninLynguists,Never tempered or pressed into patterns
24026,CunninLynguists,But just wont die instead a palpitation from the plasma
24027,CunninLynguists,Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at em
24028,CunninLynguists,I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
24029,CunninLynguists,Then off into my extremities and out into the public
24030,CunninLynguists,In a flood of shadow puppetry something in the air
24031,CunninLynguists,Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self aware
24032,CunninLynguists,Its recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
24033,CunninLynguists,Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
24034,CunninLynguists,Close encounters exacerbate his condition
24035,CunninLynguists,From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
24036,CunninLynguists,Tune into the Casio adventures
24037,CunninLynguists,When the rest of me can barely form a god damn sentence
24038,CunninLynguists,You can only see the stars when it s Don Cheadle black

24045,CunninLynguists,Zero pride in settling for less then
24046,CunninLynguists,Fighting tooth and nail no matter who prevails

24063,CunninLynguists,Try lookin for the stars when examining your dreams
24064,CunninLynguists,Could go from street singers to pop figures
24065,CunninLynguists,From block niggas to a brotha that is followin stock tickers
24066,CunninLynguists,To grow in the night you gotta create light
24067,CunninLynguists,Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight

24069,CunninLynguists,And you don t need a telescope to detect dream
24070,CunninLynguists,You blessed with a mind that can see through space
24071,CunninLynguists,On dark nights in the stars you can find your face
24072,CunninLynguists,Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
24073,CunninLynguists,Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

24083,CunninLynguists,When victory s in vain it s the same the blood coursing
24084,CunninLynguists,Of course when selfishness inside provides poison

24086,CunninLynguists,Poised when them black clouds come  round don t back down
24087,CunninLynguists,Let haters be theme music playin in the background
24088,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24089,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24090,CunninLynguists,There was a time when I couldnt find energy
24091,CunninLynguists,The only person that was feelin me was Mrs Hennessy
24092,CunninLynguists,Its like life was pinnin me down
24093,CunninLynguists,I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
24094,CunninLynguists,You aint gonna be a rapper youre not a factor
24095,CunninLynguists,You just a Kentucky boy get yourself a tractor
24096,CunninLynguists,Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
24097,CunninLynguists,Thats when the liquor and weed became a need
24098,CunninLynguists,Self esteem was lower than snorkel cities
24099,CunninLynguists,Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel s titties
24100,CunninLynguists,Then as soon as I started getting some pride
24101,CunninLynguists,My sister hydroplaned and died on I   
24102,CunninLynguists,In a family full of pride house full of tears
24103,CunninLynguists,Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
24104,CunninLynguists,Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
24105,CunninLynguists,Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
24106,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24107,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24108,CunninLynguists,I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
24109,CunninLynguists,And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
24110,CunninLynguists,Cant grow fond of past memories
24111,CunninLynguists,Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
24112,CunninLynguists,Offended by the mental imagery
24113,CunninLynguists,And suggest livin in poverty was really meant for me
24114,CunninLynguists,Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
24115,CunninLynguists,Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
24116,CunninLynguists,I cant begin to see how to control the flash backs
24117,CunninLynguists,Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
24118,CunninLynguists,Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
24119,CunninLynguists,When I dont perceive what I feel I deserve
24120,CunninLynguists,Being slurred by those not livin in my position
24121,CunninLynguists,My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
24122,CunninLynguists,And when I thought Id risen life freezes the frame
24123,CunninLynguists,So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain
24124,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24125,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24126,CunninLynguists,I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
24127,CunninLynguists,Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
24128,CunninLynguists,You know what blasphemys like cursing at God
24129,CunninLynguists,Cause you aint got shit it hurts and its hard
24130,CunninLynguists,Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
24131,CunninLynguists,Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
24132,CunninLynguists,Most of my lifes a daze got me forever lighting haze
24133,CunninLynguists,Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
24134,CunninLynguists,For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
24135,CunninLynguists,Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
24136,CunninLynguists,Few friends even then most homies is fake
24137,CunninLynguists,Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
24138,CunninLynguists,I went from the block with my fam to college exams
24139,CunninLynguists,But the pressures still there dog Im still scared
24140,CunninLynguists,But I know it will all be right in the end
24141,CunninLynguists,As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen
24142,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24143,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24144,CunninLynguists,Its four o clock on a Sunday morning
24145,CunninLynguists,Who the hell is calling my phone 
24146,CunninLynguists,Waking me up Im stretching and yawning
24147,CunninLynguists,If you had any sense youd leave me alone
24148,CunninLynguists,Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
24149,CunninLynguists,I m in jail I need bail Again the word is bond

24249,CunninLynguists,That theyd only seen polluted stream and that wasnt clean
24250,CunninLynguists,Said he could almost no longer stand the breath
24251,CunninLynguists,From this pure horror more worse than Amittyville
24252,CunninLynguists,So whats next Dont answer me yield  yup

24259,CunninLynguists,Baby is like a year and a half now and speaking
24260,CunninLynguists,More than I can say about that man with his child
24261,CunninLynguists,They cant even come face to face and share smiles
24262,CunninLynguists,Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
24263,CunninLynguists,Like she spawned a fucking anti Christ or a Satan infant
24264,CunninLynguists,Blatant mentions about family blood wont leave
24265,CunninLynguists,Loves her deeply but evil sends its opposite feed
24266,CunninLynguists,Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
24267,CunninLynguists,If he could just set it aside thered be heaven to pay
24268,CunninLynguists,Then weathered and aged time swept him to grave
24269,CunninLynguists,Love conquers all shit Id say that areas grey
24270,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why   X 
24271,CunninLynguists,Most dont even know why they believe what they believe man
24272,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24273,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg
24274,CunninLynguists,In the dark walls blocking all that light
24275,CunninLynguists,Most dont even know why they believe what they believe man
24276,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24277,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg
24278,CunninLynguists,Looking at life in retrospect its hard to regret
24279,CunninLynguists,Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
24280,CunninLynguists,Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
24281,CunninLynguists,Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
24282,CunninLynguists,And even though nobodys life is ever perfect
24283,CunninLynguists,You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
24284,CunninLynguists,Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
24285,CunninLynguists,Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
24286,CunninLynguists,People who pimp children are really raping religion
24287,CunninLynguists,The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
24288,CunninLynguists,But now the technology follows me solemnly
24289,CunninLynguists,Building the future laws to my philosophy
24290,CunninLynguists,Alzheimers cutting through like a lobotomy
24291,CunninLynguists,Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
24292,CunninLynguists,Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
24293,CunninLynguists,I survived disease and political crisis
24294,CunninLynguists,By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
24295,CunninLynguists,And now I live vicariously through my kids
24296,CunninLynguists,Like people who love the sport but cant play for shit
24297,CunninLynguists,Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
24298,CunninLynguists,I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
24299,CunninLynguists,Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
24300,CunninLynguists,But just before I vanish as I think Im at the end
24301,CunninLynguists,The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
24302,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24303,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24304,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24305,CunninLynguists,The world is changing day to day
24306,CunninLynguists,It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
24307,CunninLynguists,Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
24308,CunninLynguists,Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
24309,CunninLynguists,I feel weathered but feel like Ive been driving forever
24310,CunninLynguists,Showin up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
24311,CunninLynguists,Ive been better but all things pass
24312,CunninLynguists,This life is taking everything away but youre provided with your past
24313,CunninLynguists,So fuck it  I stick to having dreams on the road
24314,CunninLynguists,But until this dream is done Im gonna keep my eyes closed
24315,CunninLynguists,And breathe breathe when it snows
24316,CunninLynguists,Breathe when Im forced to live a life with a person on a phone
24317,CunninLynguists,Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin
24318,CunninLynguists,Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
24319,CunninLynguists,Cause after the show when the last star shines
24320,CunninLynguists,I can make this all better when I close my eyes
24321,CunninLynguists,Im in another zone where troubles gone
24322,CunninLynguists,Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
24323,CunninLynguists,A place where life is easy for everybody else
24324,CunninLynguists,I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
24325,CunninLynguists,But we dont know it where we dont show it all
24326,CunninLynguists,For life aint protocol under sky over law
24327,CunninLynguists,Im in another space where all the food is good
24328,CunninLynguists,And theres enough for everybody in my neighborhood
24329,CunninLynguists,Where all the grass is blue where we dont know bout green
24330,CunninLynguists,Cause money aint a thing I pinch myself its not a dream
24331,CunninLynguists,Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
24332,CunninLynguists,If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldnt mean a thing
24333,CunninLynguists,Between climbing and finding it not worth it
24334,CunninLynguists,Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
24335,CunninLynguists,Im so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
24336,CunninLynguists,I think of home when I close my eyes
24337,CunninLynguists,So done with the smokes and fries
24338,CunninLynguists,Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
24339,CunninLynguists,Drinks I shouldnt drink things I never write
24340,CunninLynguists,Cities I never liked now its like aight
24341,CunninLynguists,Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
24342,CunninLynguists,Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
24343,CunninLynguists,My work is love no complaints Im fine
24344,CunninLynguists,Its been a long night cant wait to close my eyes
24345,CunninLynguists,I dream of an industry ego less
24346,CunninLynguists,And free from the modern chains with these chains were so deep in love
24347,CunninLynguists,Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
24348,CunninLynguists,Dreaming a publicist wasnt  Gs a month
24349,CunninLynguists,And where its not about numbers and math
24350,CunninLynguists,And I was content with really just a couple of fans
24351,CunninLynguists,And my happiness wasnt relying on tours and a van
24352,CunninLynguists,Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
24353,CunninLynguists,With the front front row stadium packed
24354,CunninLynguists,And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
24355,CunninLynguists,And scream at them  Look at me now look at me man 
24356,CunninLynguists,Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
24357,CunninLynguists,Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
24358,CunninLynguists,Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
24359,CunninLynguists,I woke up and realized it was a dream
24360,CunninLynguists,Wide awake in the rap game but life Im asleep
24361,CunninLynguists,You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
24362,CunninLynguists,I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
24363,CunninLynguists,Part of my shine comes from the distance
24364,CunninLynguists,You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
24365,CunninLynguists,Is this business emotionally invested 
24366,CunninLynguists,Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
24367,CunninLynguists,Love is war sex is a weapon
24368,CunninLynguists,The mind is a mine so watch where youre steppin
24369,CunninLynguists,Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
24370,CunninLynguists,Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
24371,CunninLynguists,Feelings are just filling in this half baked scene
24372,CunninLynguists,To make x rated into nc   
24373,CunninLynguists,Then see everything she got she not shy
24374,CunninLynguists,Our love below so dro we most high
24375,CunninLynguists,Then wears off when what we wears on

24909,CunninLynguists,I wanted to go on Rap City and act witty

24913,CunninLynguists,And even if the world does end I cant be mad at God
24914,CunninLynguists,Cause life coulda been much worse At least Im satisfied
24915,CunninLynguists,At least my dads alive married to my mother
24916,CunninLynguists,I have a sister and friends that I could call my brothers
24917,CunninLynguists,At least I have life Some people their life was stolen
24918,CunninLynguists,Set up for a crime and behind bars is where they hold em

24921,CunninLynguists,It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience
24922,CunninLynguists,But its a blessing that I made it through this nonsense
24923,CunninLynguists,So even if this will be my last night
24924,CunninLynguists,At least when its over Ill be doin alright   
24925,CunninLynguists,Back in the   th century way way back in the day

24928,CunninLynguists,The World Trades frame got struck by planes
24929,CunninLynguists,Looking like God unleashed his fury and rained flames
24930,CunninLynguists,Exchanged pain for how America came to fame
24931,CunninLynguists,Cluthing my brain my sense of security changed
24932,CunninLynguists,Usually confidence was pure in me now fear in my veins
24933,CunninLynguists,Said  any of this shit could brang nuclear weapons
24934,CunninLynguists,   any of this shit could end at any second 
24935,CunninLynguists,If the Commander in Chief couldnt insure our protection
24936,CunninLynguists,Thats no more additions to my memorys collection
24937,CunninLynguists,Missing me and my girls matrimonial connection

24941,CunninLynguists,So I thank God for earths blessings   health
24942,CunninLynguists,Not alot of wealth but alot of peace within my self
24943,CunninLynguists,Not a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf
24944,CunninLynguists,Disclipline from loving parents though they raised me
24945,CunninLynguists,When I was young I was wild
24946,CunninLynguists, christ hope he could stand it
24947,CunninLynguists,Now I do right  wherever I can manage
24948,CunninLynguists,The devil was eating me alive but I climbed out of that sandwich
24949,CunninLynguists,Now possibly on the verge of having everything vanish
24950,CunninLynguists,Feeling as if I didnt do anything as I planned it
24951,CunninLynguists,Like I was trying to live my life right but somebody panned it
24952,CunninLynguists,But I still had love when down helping hands lifted
24953,CunninLynguists,Me up outta the mud outta the muck
24954,CunninLynguists,And outta the dark and attitude when I didnt give a fuck
24955,CunninLynguists,From them days in the park alone drinking gin by the cup
24956,CunninLynguists,Through an exitless maze wandering and constantly stuck
24957,CunninLynguists,The blessings were always there I just chose to ignore them
24958,CunninLynguists,Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
24959,CunninLynguists,Wasnt selfish with them trying to stretch and contort them
24960,CunninLynguists,And didnt let the world get to them first and distort them
24961,CunninLynguists,So as I  kick back and ponder on armeggedon
24962,CunninLynguists,And I   spit raps about where my life couldve been headin
24963,CunninLynguists,I  admit that  I do have a wonderful life
24964,CunninLynguists,So if this night was my last ill be doin alright
24965,CunninLynguists,Searching for answers is like searching for Atlantis
24966,CunninLynguists,Im working poor and Im just hurting for some chances
24967,CunninLynguists,This school of a livings like prison on a campus
24968,CunninLynguists,Show me the Monet and the pixels in that canvas
24969,CunninLynguists,Advance through my imagery I view my evil deeds
24970,CunninLynguists,When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory
24971,CunninLynguists,When I called on Mary J be my serenity
24972,CunninLynguists,So I dont see that all my enemies resembled me
24973,CunninLynguists,Im feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
24974,CunninLynguists,Im trying to place but my heart aint even in the race
24975,CunninLynguists,Ive came far enough that turning back is time wasted
24976,CunninLynguists,Imprisoned by fear I dont need no iron bracelets
24977,CunninLynguists,Whats my fate how can I escape my heart
24978,CunninLynguists,Running blind an open mind could break this dark
24979,CunninLynguists,A major spark might just make a star in this    
24980,CunninLynguists,Way under in slumber is my true self shown
24981,CunninLynguists,A glass house cracked from a few stones thrown
24982,CunninLynguists,Pane in the windows of a once happy home
24983,CunninLynguists,I m a Cheshire Cat laughin at the caged birds song
24984,CunninLynguists,A caterpillar shroomin usin fumes from my bong
24985,CunninLynguists,To cloud a land wondering what fuels what is wrong
24986,CunninLynguists,Lust in my loins vengeance in my heart
24987,CunninLynguists,Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
24988,CunninLynguists,Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
24989,CunninLynguists,I can t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
24990,CunninLynguists,That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
24991,CunninLynguists,Opinions of my health my self and wealth go off the chart
24992,CunninLynguists,My struggle to keep balance ain t a challenge it s an art
24993,CunninLynguists,Outside my sleep is silent  cause inside the war is fought

25497,CunninLynguists,No halos or hounds pitchforks or gates
25498,CunninLynguists,Or omnipotent voice that picks course or fate
25499,CunninLynguists,To the life of indecision build a dreamscape prison
25500,CunninLynguists,Where light isn t manufactured but captured inside a prism
25501,CunninLynguists,In a state between asleep and awake
25502,CunninLynguists,Feels closest to hypnosis where the infinite wait
25503,CunninLynguists,Then the fog dissipates revealing crimson fields
25504,CunninLynguists,Crept on by a fawn with flaming heels
25505,CunninLynguists,Eyes red as stop signs and a mane of quills
25506,CunninLynguists,As it gaze past hills of diamond trees
25507,CunninLynguists,I see a silhouette rest upon golden knees
25508,CunninLynguists,For the body of a goddess and a face of dreams
25509,CunninLynguists,A half naked Meagan Good in a pagan hood
25510,CunninLynguists,Kiss me on the cheek we didn t speak but I understood
25511,CunninLynguists,It wasn t Heaven that I was seeking but a haven I sought
25512,CunninLynguists,A canvas of the mind painted with my thoughts
25513,CunninLynguists,Everything ain t what it seems
25514,CunninLynguists,I wake up to find I m inside of a dream inside of a dream
25515,CunninLynguists,See buried deep beside the seams of my screams
25516,CunninLynguists,Of beings and otherworldly things rarely seen
25517,CunninLynguists,Might be psychosis or maybe I chose this
25518,CunninLynguists,The night approaches every time the eye closes
25519,CunninLynguists,I see a burning bush feel like I m Moses
25520,CunninLynguists,Burn so much kush I feel like amosis
25521,CunninLynguists,All my images are morgues and wounds
25522,CunninLynguists,And every fork in the road moves through Freud and Jung
25523,CunninLynguists,In the darkness no orchard blooms
25524,CunninLynguists,A state so dark sparks from the torch is consumed
25525,CunninLynguists,It s like I live in a fortress of doom
25526,CunninLynguists,In the forest where the blood pores were forced from my wounds

25837,CunninLynguists,Of those in this winter with no mink or folk
25838,CunninLynguists,Weathering this desert with no drink to cope
25839,CunninLynguists,Some chain smoke with no link or hope
25840,CunninLynguists,You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
25841,CunninLynguists,The fastest can t run from who they are
25842,CunninLynguists,I d run from self but no man can run that far
25843,CunninLynguists,Turn the page eventually I hit a certain age
25844,CunninLynguists,Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you re afraid
25845,CunninLynguists,Success can often be a perfect cage
25846,CunninLynguists,Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
25847,CunninLynguists,A prisoner trapped in the regret
25848,CunninLynguists,Cuz the ego can t keep up if they happen to reject it
25849,CunninLynguists,Sometimes you want so bad to be respected
25850,CunninLynguists,Goin after it  til you ve left your happiness neglected
25851,CunninLynguists,I ve seen the weakness in grown men
25852,CunninLynguists,Playing games with their pain they cheat but they don t win

25859,CunninLynguists,I m Bustin Loose no Wilder just a Pryor  prior 
25860,CunninLynguists,And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
25861,CunninLynguists,Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
25862,CunninLynguists,Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
25863,CunninLynguists,Meet a fan kick it witcha take a picture
25864,CunninLynguists,Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister

25875,CunninLynguists,If it would help I d even die for you
25876,CunninLynguists,I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
25877,CunninLynguists,Over against my own will surrounded by illusions
25878,CunninLynguists,Fighting to stay positive however losing
25879,CunninLynguists,Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
25880,CunninLynguists,The human heart does more than just pump blood
25881,CunninLynguists,It pumps love at least I know that mine did once
25882,CunninLynguists,But a large piece of it was undone
25883,CunninLynguists,And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
25884,CunninLynguists,Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
25885,CunninLynguists,Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
25886,CunninLynguists,But be certain of your faith and you ll acquire the ability
25887,CunninLynguists,To expose witches and burn them at the stake
25888,CunninLynguists,I m looking for love I m done searching for a date
25889,CunninLynguists,Ive been alone for years but it s worth it if you wait
25890,CunninLynguists,Personally late s better than never at all
25891,CunninLynguists,So when I brush myself off whenever I fall tell me
25892,CunninLynguists,Oh yeah That s what the last one said
25893,CunninLynguists,Unfortunately I was mad misled
25894,CunninLynguists,I ran on E til no more gas was left
25895,CunninLynguists,The most I got from her was ass and bread
25896,CunninLynguists,But trust was lost like Kanye s fashion sense
25897,CunninLynguists,Accidents happen when you live with the weak
25898,CunninLynguists,But it s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
25899,CunninLynguists,That s enough reason to get into beef
25900,CunninLynguists,Throw all your spouse s shit on the street quit  retreat
25901,CunninLynguists,But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
25902,CunninLynguists,So please for my sake stay by me this earth is cold
25903,CunninLynguists,And I m freezing like I ve been lying in dirt and snow
25904,CunninLynguists,I ve searched the globe for a person who knows
25905,CunninLynguists,The true meaning of love you could be the one
25906,CunninLynguists,If you mean what you say we could link up
25907,CunninLynguists,And use what we learned from our exes in the past
25908,CunninLynguists,But wait cause I got another question to ask and that s 
25909,CunninLynguists,Sounds good and if you mean it I ll hook up with you this evening
25910,CunninLynguists,Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
25911,CunninLynguists,The touch of a king when you re my queen
25912,CunninLynguists,And trust is the the key in every relationship
25913,CunninLynguists,But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
25914,CunninLynguists,But looks can be deceiving
25915,CunninLynguists,Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
25916,CunninLynguists,So don t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
25917,CunninLynguists,That s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
25918,CunninLynguists,But the first line of this song already explained
25919,CunninLynguists,That my arteries were drained now all of me is tame
25920,CunninLynguists,So stay beside me cause I don t wanna be estranged
25921,CunninLynguists,As soon as time found them they were saved
25922,CunninLynguists,And still lay there to this day
25923,CunninLynguists,But if this should ever change
25924,CunninLynguists,Just stay and I mma do the same
25925,CunninLynguists,The darkness of the night has gone

25946,CunninLynguists,No brown on the streets where baristas rule
25947,CunninLynguists,And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
25948,CunninLynguists,For the tenants thats in it
25949,CunninLynguists,But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
25950,CunninLynguists,To a brand new prison they can sit til the bars are all  gone 
25951,CunninLynguists,They trying to get us out the hood them people want us  gone 
25952,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone

25966,CunninLynguists,Searching but I ve been told the silver lining is  gone 
25967,CunninLynguists,This is when fear talks ears off
25968,CunninLynguists,Many corporations calculate what a tear cost
25969,CunninLynguists,Morals break down like they biodegradable
25970,CunninLynguists,Too keep the faith or give it up

26273,CunninLynguists,Become infected with feelings so Im electing this evil
26274,CunninLynguists,To end my life without reason cause Im indicted for treason
26275,CunninLynguists,Closin my eyes and Im leakin draggin the knife till Im bleedin
26276,CunninLynguists,Cause its the life that Im seekin feels only right that Im meetin
26277,CunninLynguists,With Jesus seeking redemption but he dont want my repentance
26278,CunninLynguists,For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
26279,CunninLynguists,Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
26280,CunninLynguists,The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessings
26281,CunninLynguists,Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
26282,CunninLynguists,Parents repeatedly sentenced heroin needles on dressers
26283,CunninLynguists,They use to feed their infection I cant repeat indescretions
26284,CunninLynguists,So I pause for reflection long for honest affection
26285,CunninLynguists,And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
26286,CunninLynguists,If you knew where my head is when Im doing these records
26287,CunninLynguists,Youd never listen to my music again I cant let you

26294,CunninLynguists,The agreement turned cement
26295,CunninLynguists,Hip Hop the vinyl frontier
26296,CunninLynguists,Two turntables a mic and a cold stereo DJ one MC the imperial
26297,CunninLynguists,Many many put their muse to it
26298,CunninLynguists,Sent bop sent rock sent blues through it
26299,CunninLynguists,From classical to jazz we can who s who it
26300,CunninLynguists,Or blow the dust off and groove to it
26301,CunninLynguists,You know that crackle give the best high
26302,CunninLynguists,Give me a needle a cartridge a partridge some tree   s and a    let it be
26303,CunninLynguists,A new format hit the scene like way back
26304,CunninLynguists,It was smaller and more convenient than   track
26305,CunninLynguists,You could pop it in your car on a long drive
26306,CunninLynguists,Play the album or fast forward to song five
26307,CunninLynguists,If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
26308,CunninLynguists,It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
26309,CunninLynguists,Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
26310,CunninLynguists,When they was on the air I was on the pause button
26311,CunninLynguists,I had the best taste but I aint trying to cause nothing
26312,CunninLynguists,Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws
26313,CunninLynguists,Cats used to battle this shit used to cause wars
26314,CunninLynguists,We would trade tapes that was the best it could be
26315,CunninLynguists,Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
26316,CunninLynguists,Having the best tapes was like a status symbol
26317,CunninLynguists,The yellow tape purple tape to the baddest demo
26318,CunninLynguists,Battles travel from the Bronx to Baltimore
26319,CunninLynguists,They would stand by the speaker to record them all
26320,CunninLynguists,Them same tapes that was labeled with a thick marker
26321,CunninLynguists,Made the neighbourhood rappers want to spit sharper
26322,CunninLynguists,If my tape pop trust I was ready man
26323,CunninLynguists,A razor blade scotch tape and a steady hand
26324,CunninLynguists,My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life
26325,CunninLynguists,My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle
26326,CunninLynguists,Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the beat
26327,CunninLynguists,Stab the repeat button and keep running
26328,CunninLynguists,And thats something you cant get from tape dubbing
26329,CunninLynguists,Skip the skips with a flick of the wrist
26330,CunninLynguists,More time to check whats sick on the list
26331,CunninLynguists,The fickle dismissed this little digital disk
26332,CunninLynguists,But try and play vinyl in the whip itll skip
26333,CunninLynguists,And its    Im trying to get laid now

26344,CunninLynguists,The past feels even further with every second
26345,CunninLynguists,Off the record the coming and going of Kbps
26346,CunninLynguists,In the day of the instant message
26347,CunninLynguists,The message is misdirected and the receiver seems to be disconnected
26348,CunninLynguists,But dont complain love game
26349,CunninLynguists,Even after the flood came and left our neighbors over saturated
26350,CunninLynguists,With no computer love just computer bugs

26422,CunninLynguists,Far away though believe I ain t complaining
26423,CunninLynguists,Rather explaining that unless this southern rain end
26424,CunninLynguists,We ll show proof we s as real as you
26425,CunninLynguists,Needing a roof some shoes dolla bills and food
26426,CunninLynguists,Two from The Dirty met with mismatched skin
26427,CunninLynguists,Acknowledged first that one day this track may end
26428,CunninLynguists,When there s no more steam in that engine
26429,CunninLynguists,Yet hopefully clean streams be an astringent
26430,CunninLynguists,But needs outweigh cheese tryna stay in contention
26431,CunninLynguists, For the love is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension
26432,CunninLynguists, For the love is a hard reason to keep my life in suspension
26433,CunninLynguists, For the love is a hard reason to keep our lives in suspension yeah
26434,CunninLynguists,What do you do when the people go home
26435,CunninLynguists,And what do you do when the show is all done
26436,CunninLynguists,I know what I ll do in the alone of my time
26437,CunninLynguists,But what will I do with the leftover wine

26439,CunninLynguists,What ll you do lay it down lay it down lay it down again
26440,CunninLynguists,Poor me pour me a shot of patron
26441,CunninLynguists,Cigarillo or bordello I just gotta be blown
26442,CunninLynguists,In a silicone zone where titties are grown
26443,CunninLynguists,And sessions in the recession where fifties are thrown
26444,CunninLynguists,Rose petals pedaled within cities of stone
26445,CunninLynguists,Reefer and liquor dance my chemical romance
26446,CunninLynguists,Like a tux with gold cuffs that waits to be worn
26447,CunninLynguists,Loves in the haze of a flashback
26448,CunninLynguists,Those that invest deeply need be gettin they cash back
26449,CunninLynguists,Being in lust with love feels so dreamy
26450,CunninLynguists,Till it s shattered in beautiful pieces scattered beneath me
26451,CunninLynguists,I still chase it you gotta believe me
26452,CunninLynguists,I just don t think it s as instant as an instance on tv
26453,CunninLynguists,We try to close the distance but persistence ain t easy
26454,CunninLynguists,There s a ribbon in the sky if you listen to Stevie
26455,CunninLynguists,Problem is my arms can t reach that far
26456,CunninLynguists,Or stretch that high is it best I fly
26457,CunninLynguists,With the wings of a goose mixed with red bull
26458,CunninLynguists,And a night cap slapped on to keep my head cool
26459,CunninLynguists,Awaken in a state of confusion
26460,CunninLynguists,Dressing quickly to get back to my city
26461,CunninLynguists,I ve seen all the things that pass me by
26462,CunninLynguists,I cling to my dreams as I grab the sky
26463,CunninLynguists,Your search for answers will end in agony
26464,CunninLynguists,One thing is certain that is my destiny
26465,CunninLynguists,Standing in front of you naked crying again and I feel like a tyrant
26466,CunninLynguists,I told you once that I loved you more than music I was lying
26467,CunninLynguists,But I swear you re the closest second
26468,CunninLynguists,And I am the most depressive

26479,CunninLynguists,Playing the cards I was dealt as an only child with a single mom
26480,CunninLynguists,I got Abandonment issues for days and if you make me mad I m gone
26481,CunninLynguists,Now come and make me right while my eyes are dancing
26482,CunninLynguists,You see just how I m standing
26483,CunninLynguists,Naked as in ass out dusted without a cent
26484,CunninLynguists,Sex was twerkin for us and love spray was the scent
26485,CunninLynguists,Made it rain while we singles so emotionally spent
26486,CunninLynguists,While building our house of love she came short on the rent
26487,CunninLynguists,Fell head over heels but couldnt feel the decent
26488,CunninLynguists,The quicker the lights flicker the quicker the liquor hits
26489,CunninLynguists,I was feral out to get lucky
26490,CunninLynguists,Her ass was heaven above me
26491,CunninLynguists,And I was dying to go there
26492,CunninLynguists,As soon the spirits touched me
26493,CunninLynguists,Club lights can turn Misses Fugly to Misses Fucks Me
26494,CunninLynguists,Cus I aint talkin slick trick dont confuse it with rusty
26495,CunninLynguists,We left our love in that condom under your sisters truck seat
26496,CunninLynguists,My bucket wasnt fly enough for you after our first meet

26527,CunninLynguists,If youve experienced everything except a purpose
26528,CunninLynguists,Then youve missed everything that was meant to be caught
26529,CunninLynguists,Life sessions arent lessons that can be simply taught
26530,CunninLynguists,You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter
26531,CunninLynguists,In the field we choose to scatter like lice
26532,CunninLynguists,Instead of coming together and keeping it tight
26533,CunninLynguists,Its hard to be alone deep in the night
26534,CunninLynguists,I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
26535,CunninLynguists,But so many times I fall in between the lines
26536,CunninLynguists,Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
26537,CunninLynguists,If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight
26538,CunninLynguists,You might as well freebase on pipes
26539,CunninLynguists,Ive fallen down but I got up friend
26540,CunninLynguists,And again its nobodies but my fault it didnt end

26544,CunninLynguists,Being peaceful at heart helps me see through the dark
26545,CunninLynguists,Like dogs barkin its hard for evil people to start bullshit
26546,CunninLynguists,With a literally cool kid whose only form of battlin is through music
26547,CunninLynguists,If you hold yourself tight you cant lose it
26548,CunninLynguists,Life or death its up to you who you cruise with
26549,CunninLynguists,Exercise knowledge to increase your wealth
26550,CunninLynguists,If you know yourself youll be shown your wealth  x  
26551,CunninLynguists,Sometimes I ask myself a question
26552,CunninLynguists,Is my lack of inner reflection
26553,CunninLynguists,Some type of indication of what state my life is in 
26554,CunninLynguists,They keep piping in elevator music
26555,CunninLynguists,Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
26556,CunninLynguists,When I reflect back and recollect that
26557,CunninLynguists,I was born into the state of walking slumber
26558,CunninLynguists,Taught numbers realize Im dirt poor

26568,CunninLynguists,Assume the description of my life and its reality
26569,CunninLynguists,Is on the warm side of fatality
26570,CunninLynguists,Its not fair the way you challenge me
26571,CunninLynguists,Or the silent way my talents be
26572,CunninLynguists,Hidden inside these translations
26573,CunninLynguists,Emancipation as I try to dab the slate clean
26574,CunninLynguists,Futile attempts to make my fate glean
26575,CunninLynguists,It makes me want to fall reclusive

32774,Drake,I got her fucked up shorty aww yeah
82090,Lupe Fiasco,Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
82091,Lupe Fiasco,Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
82092,Lupe Fiasco,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself
82105,Lupe Fiasco,As most important source of help
82106,Lupe Fiasco,And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
82107,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82108,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
82109,Lupe Fiasco,On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
82110,Lupe Fiasco,It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
82111,Lupe Fiasco,They understand the Internet better than their parents
82112,Lupe Fiasco,Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
82113,Lupe Fiasco,Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
82114,Lupe Fiasco,A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
82115,Lupe Fiasco,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
82116,Lupe Fiasco, Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
82117,Lupe Fiasco,Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches  
82118,Lupe Fiasco,Now lets say that they less concerned with him
82119,Lupe Fiasco,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
82120,Lupe Fiasco,Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
82121,Lupe Fiasco,Reality check Im not trippin
82122,Lupe Fiasco,They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
82123,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82124,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82125,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82126,Lupe Fiasco,Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using  bitch as a lesson
82127,Lupe Fiasco,But as a psychological weapon
82128,Lupe Fiasco,To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
82129,Lupe Fiasco,Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
82130,Lupe Fiasco, Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
82131,Lupe Fiasco,Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
82132,Lupe Fiasco,Sho enough in this little world
82133,Lupe Fiasco,The little boy meets one of those little girls
82134,Lupe Fiasco,And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
82135,Lupe Fiasco,He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
82136,Lupe Fiasco,She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
82137,Lupe Fiasco,He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
82138,Lupe Fiasco,Momma never dressed like that
82139,Lupe Fiasco,Come out the house hot mess like that
82140,Lupe Fiasco,Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
82141,Lupe Fiasco,Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
82142,Lupe Fiasco,He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
82143,Lupe Fiasco, Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
82144,Lupe Fiasco,But  bad mean bad to him  bitch dont play a part
82145,Lupe Fiasco,But  bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
82146,Lupe Fiasco,But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre 
82147,Lupe Fiasco,Tell em bitch bad woman good
82148,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82149,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82150,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82151,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82152,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better greatest motherhood
82153,Lupe Fiasco,Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
82154,Lupe Fiasco,Vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
82155,Lupe Fiasco,To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
82156,Lupe Fiasco,Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
82157,Lupe Fiasco,Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm 
82158,Lupe Fiasco,But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
82159,Lupe Fiasco,So what powers cowards to get them to the top
82160,Lupe Fiasco,Just to fall asleep listening to Bach 
82161,Lupe Fiasco,The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
82162,Lupe Fiasco,Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
82163,Lupe Fiasco,That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
82164,Lupe Fiasco,They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
82165,Lupe Fiasco,Now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling 
82166,Lupe Fiasco,And whats the talking without the match feeling
82167,Lupe Fiasco,Thats buried living And cherry picking
82168,Lupe Fiasco,Every lemon from your berry system
82169,Lupe Fiasco,Then proceed with the pack feeding
82170,Lupe Fiasco,When I was young I had visions of another world
82171,Lupe Fiasco,Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
82172,Lupe Fiasco,Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
82173,Lupe Fiasco,Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
82174,Lupe Fiasco,I like my pancakes cut in swirls
82175,Lupe Fiasco,Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
82176,Lupe Fiasco,I like cartoons southern cities with large moons
82177,Lupe Fiasco,Faith healers ex female drug dealers and art booms
82178,Lupe Fiasco,Apologize for my weird mix
82179,Lupe Fiasco,What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
82180,Lupe Fiasco,And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
82181,Lupe Fiasco,And smells like shotguns and deer piss
82182,Lupe Fiasco,They on their hunt kind of salty that Im going hard
82183,Lupe Fiasco,First part of a party that I throw in parts
82184,Lupe Fiasco,One minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
82185,Lupe Fiasco,But thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
82186,Lupe Fiasco,I run the Gambit like Im throwing cards
82187,Lupe Fiasco,From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
82188,Lupe Fiasco,Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
82189,Lupe Fiasco,Nerd gang make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
82190,Lupe Fiasco,A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
82191,Lupe Fiasco,Backup the wordplay playing at the mans states
82192,Lupe Fiasco,Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
82193,Lupe Fiasco,And when demand brakes Im reflectious what they cant face
82194,Lupe Fiasco,My peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
82195,Lupe Fiasco,The unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
82196,Lupe Fiasco,That hovers above cities like weather men
82197,Lupe Fiasco,Whatever better to tell ya weather comin
82198,Lupe Fiasco,I prefer girls to reign all over the world
82199,Lupe Fiasco,And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
82200,Lupe Fiasco,Or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
82201,Lupe Fiasco,Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
82202,Lupe Fiasco,But reign like Queens that reign over made man
82203,Lupe Fiasco,And not Queen like Queen killer rhapsody bohemian Queen
82204,Lupe Fiasco,But Queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave
82205,Lupe Fiasco,So you make a fan by waving your hand Im talking wave like you saying  Hey man  
82206,Lupe Fiasco,And not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
82207,Lupe Fiasco,You gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
82208,Lupe Fiasco,And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
82209,Lupe Fiasco,And especially when youre recording
82210,Lupe Fiasco,Cause thats the portion thats important

84426,Lupe Fiasco,A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
84427,Lupe Fiasco,They discover ancient cars on even older streets
84428,Lupe Fiasco,And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
84429,Lupe Fiasco,A culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth

84434,Lupe Fiasco,That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
84435,Lupe Fiasco,From the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
84436,Lupe Fiasco,Everythings so organized They had to be well behaved
84437,Lupe Fiasco,Assumed they had clean energy little to no enemies
84438,Lupe Fiasco,Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
84439,Lupe Fiasco,Religions kinda complex Kinda hard to figure out
84440,Lupe Fiasco,But this must be the temple
84441,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84442,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84443,Lupe Fiasco,In the same suit that he was buried in
84444,Lupe Fiasco,Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
84445,Lupe Fiasco,Yes he was still fresh to death
84446,Lupe Fiasco,Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
84447,Lupe Fiasco,He still had it cause they couldnt find it
84448,Lupe Fiasco,And the bullets from his enemies
84449,Lupe Fiasco,Sat like two inches behind it
84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
84457,Lupe Fiasco,Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
84458,Lupe Fiasco,He saw that the latch was broken
84459,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84460,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84461,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84462,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84463,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84482,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84483,Lupe Fiasco,Caught the reflection in the window
84484,Lupe Fiasco,Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
84485,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah and gettin back in his lane
84486,Lupe Fiasco,First he had to find something to slang
84487,Lupe Fiasco,Walked right past the same spot
84488,Lupe Fiasco,That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
84489,Lupe Fiasco,It just felt weird being on the opposite
84490,Lupe Fiasco,They figured that he wasnt from there
84491,Lupe Fiasco,So they pulled out and robbed him
84492,Lupe Fiasco,With the same gun they shot him with
84493,Lupe Fiasco,Put it to his head and said
84494,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84495,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84496,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die

84506,Lupe Fiasco,Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
84507,Lupe Fiasco,Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
84508,Lupe Fiasco,Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
84509,Lupe Fiasco,And they sink in the same sea that we walk
84510,Lupe Fiasco,Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
