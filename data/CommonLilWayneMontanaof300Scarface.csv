22376,Common,Some say that God is Black and the devils White
22377,Common,Well the devil is wrong and God is whats right
22378,Common,I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
22379,Common,The rain aint gone but I can still see clear
22380,Common,As a child given religion with no answer to why
22381,Common,Just told believe in Jesus cause for me he did die
22382,Common,Curiosity killed the catechism
22383,Common,Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
22384,Common,And became a slave to master self
22385,Common,A rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health
22386,Common,My mind had dealt with the books of Zen Tao the lessons
22387,Common,Quran and the Bible to me they all vital
22388,Common,And got truth within em gotta read them boys
22389,Common,You just cant skim em different branches of belief
22390,Common,But one root that stem em but people of the venom try to trim em
22391,Common,And use religion as an emblem
22392,Common,When it should be a natural way of life
22393,Common,Who am I or they to say to whom you pray aint right
22394,Common,Thats who got you doing right and got you this far
22395,Common,Whether you say  in Jesus name or  Hum do Allah 
22396,Common,Long as you know its a bein thats supreme to you
22397,Common,You let that show towards others in the things you do
22398,Common,Cause when the trumpets blowin   elders surround the throne
22399,Common,Only        gon get it baby
22400,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22401,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22402,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22403,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me
22404,Common,So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didnt earn
22405,Common,Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
22406,Common,Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
22407,Common,Ive finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
22408,Common,Cause its hard to correct yourself when you dont know who you are in the first place
22409,Common,So I try to find the clue in you
22410,Common,But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
22411,Common,Whyre we being lied to I aint know our history was purposely hidden
22412,Common,Damn something in me wanna know who I am
22413,Common,So I began my search my journey started in church
22414,Common,It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
22415,Common,Hustlin was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
22416,Common,Taught me survival from this evil Im just gonna have to deal with
22417,Common,And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
22418,Common,It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
22419,Common,Takin elder advice read the Bible the Koran
22420,Common,Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
22421,Common,Hold on this aint right Jesus wasnt White
22422,Common,Some leads were granted with insight
22423,Common,And its all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
22424,Common,He still created with the imperfection of man
22425,Common,So with following I disagree
22426,Common,By no means have I forgotten or forgiven whats been done to me but
22427,Common,I do know the Devil aint no White man the Devils a spiritual mind
22428,Common,Thats color blind theres evil White folk and evil niggas
22429,Common,You gon surely find theres no positivity without negativity
22430,Common,But one side you gonna have to choose
22431,Common,Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
22432,Common,So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
22433,Common,Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and cant follow your lesson
22434,Common,If a seeds sown you make sure its known you make sure its grown
22435,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22436,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22437,Common,If you God then save your own dont mentally enslave your own
22438,Common,I have taken and Ive earned
22439,Common,I have failed and I have tried
22440,Common,Found joy through all my pain
22441,Common,I just wanna be happy with being me

109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
109997,Scarface,I woke up from a dream feeling all good

110007,Scarface,The streets swallow them then life overpower them
110008,Scarface,Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
110009,Scarface,Crash tested a dummy high volume

110011,Scarface,  percent of our futures off in prison
110012,Scarface,Prescription for my mental exorcism

110014,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110015,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud

110117,Scarface,They wanna learn the game from an old school
110118,Scarface,I give em strategies to sleep on
110119,Scarface,So when they put me in the grave they could keep on

110144,Scarface,You dont upstrap unless you have to
110145,Scarface,Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
110146,Scarface,Dig two graves just in case its two bodies
110147,Scarface,And never bring a stick to a gunfight
110148,Scarface,One shot one kill you get one life

110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
