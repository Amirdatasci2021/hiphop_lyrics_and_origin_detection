11411,Big L,Dont touch the mic if you unable to spit
11412,Big L,Flamboyant is the label Im with motherfucker
11413,Big L,There are too many MCs who are overrated
11414,Big L,You ask me they wasnt even supposed to make it
11415,Big L,In the rap biz they dont know what rap is
11416,Big L,So give it up become a actor or a actress
11417,Big L,Or a producer cause you fail to use the
11418,Big L,Mic right so take flight before I bruise ya
11419,Big L,For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
11420,Big L,You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
11421,Big L,Hey yo Im serious Big L aint playin games
11422,Big L,I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names
11423,Big L,But deep down inside you know who you are
11424,Big L,Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
11425,Big L,And that really gets on my nerve
11426,Big L,When a rapper gets the credit that he dont deserve
11427,Big L,Goin platinum and dont have no soul
11428,Big L,Some rappers are mad nice and dont even go gold
11429,Big L,I dont like the way its goin down
11430,Big L,Because it should be the other way around
11431,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11432,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11433,Big L,I dont understand it  I dont understand it 
11434,Big L,How MCs take this rap game for granted
11435,Big L,I dont understand man how rappers cold transform
11436,Big L,One minute youre hardcore and raw
11437,Big L,Thats what you was known for but not no more
11438,Big L,You changed you rearranged
11439,Big L,Youre not the same your raps are plain
11440,Big L,That explain why you lost your fame
11441,Big L,Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
11442,Big L,You turned pop now you no longer gain props
11443,Big L,Whos fault is that Nobodys but your own black
11444,Big L,Used to make fat tracks jack but now youre stone wack
11445,Big L,So MCs dont ever step out your range
11446,Big L,And only change with the time
11447,Big L,Unless you get dropped like a dime
11448,Big L,Go for yours like Im goin for mine
11449,Big L,But if youre rough stay rough if youre dap stay dapper
11450,Big L,And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
11451,Big L,Just fulfill your own needs
11452,Big L,Some rappers wore gold chains and now theyre wearin beads 
11453,Big L,This is how it should be done
11454,Big L,Im not the one and my raps is strong like rum
11455,Big L,But some MCs grab the mic and sound dumb
11456,Big L,Plus slum  How come  Rap skills they have none
11457,Big L,And I wonder how the hell they records sell
11458,Big L,They raps are stale and frail
11459,Big L,Theyre false like fairy tales
11460,Big L,Your technique and everything you speaks weak
11461,Big L,You got a little airplay because of your beats
11462,Big L,Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
11463,Big L,Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
11464,Big L,Your raps border wack and you went on tour with that
11465,Big L,Crap dont understand it cause rhyme skills you lack
11466,Big L,I got more soul that Nike Airs givin MCs nightmares
11467,Big L,Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they dont write theirs
11468,Big L,But still call themselves MCs
11469,Big L,Some people was born in heaven
11470,Big L,With a silver spoon in they mouth
11471,Big L,And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
11472,Big L,And never had to work hard for nothing
11473,Big L,Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
11474,Big L,Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
11475,Big L,And had to work hard for everything they got
11476,Big L,And never had nothing handed to them   and never will
11477,Big L,And life already seems to me like its heading for a dead end
11478,Big L,Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
11479,Big L,My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
11480,Big L,Nobody knows how I feel its quite ill
11481,Big L,Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
11482,Big L,Too ashamed to walk the streets
11483,Big L,Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
11484,Big L,Even my holidays got damaged
11485,Big L,Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
11486,Big L,And every day I ask myself  How will I make it  
11487,Big L,It seems like my lifes been cursed ever since I was a child
11488,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11489,Big L,I walk around with a frown I got no reason to smile
11490,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11491,Big L,Aiyo times was rough I had to grow up foul
11492,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11493,Big L,I always knew that Id end up doing time on the Isle
11494,Big L,And how will I make it I wont thats how
11495,Big L,Five years passed by now Im at the age of   
11496,Big L,No more fun and games its time to get cream
11497,Big L,Cause Im about to burst its like my life was cursed
11498,Big L,I went to church prayed everyday and it still got worse
11499,Big L,Soon I ran into a couple of guns

11501,Big L,Now everyday I creep with the heat aint nothing sweet
11502,Big L,I rob for meat If I dont steal I dont eat
11503,Big L,Then I lost control and started going too far
11504,Big L,Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
11505,Big L,Where I grew up it was a living Hell
11506,Big L,Then I started to realize Im better off in a prison cell
11507,Big L,Now I can sleep now I can eat
11508,Big L,Cant hit skins but I wasnt hitting skins when I was in the street
11509,Big L,And every day I ask myself How will I make it 
11510,Big L,Doing time was full of stress G
11511,Big L,All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
11512,Big L,One tried to test me didnt find it humorous
11513,Big L,Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
11514,Big L,My time came to a cease Im back on the streets again

11520,Big L,My whole life was deserted
11521,Big L,Either Ima go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it 
11522,Big L,All I tried to do was live the one life that I got

105342,Royce Da 59,Recovering alcoholic I grew up on  Mile
105343,Royce Da 59,Uh Im not a gangster drug dealer or thug nigga

105345,Royce Da 59,Now sometime around   I found my calling
105346,Royce Da 59,And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
105347,Royce Da 59,Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
105348,Royce Da 59,But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
105349,Royce Da 59,My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
105350,Royce Da 59,Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
105351,Royce Da 59,My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter

105362,Royce Da 59,Because the bus stop I had to walk to
105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice

105388,Royce Da 59,Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us

105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see

105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show

105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out

105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
