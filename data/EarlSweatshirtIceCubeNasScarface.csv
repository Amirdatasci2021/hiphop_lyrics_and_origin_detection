47474,Ice Cube,How to survive in South Central  what you do  
47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive

109962,Scarface,That they keep us in the dark know they act
109963,Scarface,We react all surprised and not realize that this shit a trap

109989,Scarface,Cause mane Ive been a loyal dude and you can trust that
109990,Scarface,But loyalty versus greed equals fuck that
109991,Scarface,I need to talk but there aint no one to listen
109992,Scarface,Lost inside a mental exorcism
109993,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
109994,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud
109997,Scarface,I woke up from a dream feeling all good
109998,Scarface,Prayed for better days ahead but what was yall doing
109999,Scarface,Lost stuck in a stand still waiting for a hand out

110005,Scarface,Uncle in jail daddy dead and their mammas
110006,Scarface,Cant teach them how to be men grow up being followers
110007,Scarface,The streets swallow them then life overpower them
110008,Scarface,Then off to the pen where the old heads devour them
110009,Scarface,Crash tested a dummy high volume
110010,Scarface,Only God can judge but yall niggas is comical
110011,Scarface,  percent of our futures off in prison
110012,Scarface,Prescription for my mental exorcism
110013,Scarface,Sometimes I close my eyes trying to hide from the pain
110014,Scarface,Things in my past are catching up fast living life against the grain
110015,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
110016,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

110693,Scarface,Through a replica of reality tryin to make it life like
110694,Scarface,But yet and still I let my son be a kid
110695,Scarface,Just give him up the real exactly like my momma did

110724,Scarface,And got a bigger stick to fight with
110725,Scarface,Im young and black so my choice aint a nightstick
110726,Scarface,Because we livin in a concentration set
110727,Scarface,And everyday we face to face with death
110728,Scarface,I seen my homies go and come
110729,Scarface,And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from
110730,Scarface,So I know my numbers comin up
110731,Scarface,So I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin up
110732,Scarface,And even though I hate killin off my own kind
110733,Scarface,I gotta be a man and as a man Im a defend mine
110734,Scarface,My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
110735,Scarface,Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
110736,Scarface,So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
110737,Scarface,Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit
110738,Scarface,And the cops is in the same vote
110739,Scarface,Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
110740,Scarface,They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
110741,Scarface,They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
110742,Scarface,And now the storys all twisted up
110743,Scarface,And if they gave the cop the chair
110744,Scarface,I really wouldnt give a fuck
110745,Scarface,Because she left my partners family with memories
110746,Scarface,And after hearin this I know you gon remember me
110747,Scarface,But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
110748,Scarface,I see his parents and then I started breakin up
110749,Scarface,Because I know what you did was wrong
110750,Scarface,But you wont realize until you dead and gone
110751,Scarface,It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
110752,Scarface,You straight up shot him from behind
110753,Scarface,But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
110758,Scarface,Then in reality you took care of your business
110759,Scarface,But regardless I know you wanna kill me
110760,Scarface,But I aint goin out like dat
