23514,CunninLynguists,Love aint for the faint of heart
23515,CunninLynguists,Start training this game is hard
23516,CunninLynguists,And arduous youre gonna play in the dark like when it rains in the park
23517,CunninLynguists,Youre hardly conscious of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic
23518,CunninLynguists,To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
23519,CunninLynguists,Now youre working yourself out the same as when you strain with a nautilus
23520,CunninLynguists,And youre willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
23521,CunninLynguists,If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
23522,CunninLynguists,Then do you really regret when youve shredded your promises 
23523,CunninLynguists,Now Ive tested the waters kid Sipped it rippled the pond a bit
23524,CunninLynguists,Visits have been abolished and this shits killing my confidence
23525,CunninLynguists,Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment 
23526,CunninLynguists,If you miss chicks when theyre around the phrase  Lets quit isnt an option
23527,CunninLynguists,You best fix whatevers wrong and just move on and get on with it
23528,CunninLynguists,Cause Youll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
23529,CunninLynguists,Its sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch
23530,CunninLynguists,When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
23531,CunninLynguists,Cause It isnt really my time is it Shit I just found the watch
23532,CunninLynguists,But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock
23533,CunninLynguists,And I cant die without trying my hands tied in knots
23534,CunninLynguists,Knowing that Ill never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
23535,CunninLynguists,Love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of
23536,CunninLynguists,Death  its as massive a shock
23537,CunninLynguists,And to intellects its a fuckin smack in the crotch
23538,CunninLynguists,Its a cancer that rots your soul tosses demons off of the road
23539,CunninLynguists,Just use caution and know that love aint nothing but a loss of control
23540,CunninLynguists,Lovell have you nervous doing stupid shit on purpose
23541,CunninLynguists,Brain out of service words slurred when you blurt shit
23542,CunninLynguists,Studderin utterin non sensical shit in your verses
23543,CunninLynguists,Feeling like a shirtless four breasted woman in a circus
23544,CunninLynguists,Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
23545,CunninLynguists,Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
23546,CunninLynguists,So girls create a false world of filling on boys
23547,CunninLynguists,Exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
23548,CunninLynguists,But when you have it theres nothing like it you get excited
23549,CunninLynguists,Seeking those who provide it on phones talking to psychics
23550,CunninLynguists,Some fear it spend their entire lives trying to fight it
23551,CunninLynguists,Living in a confusing Hayes like theyre grooving to Isaac
23552,CunninLynguists,It aint the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
23553,CunninLynguists,It aint easily learnable with definitions in tact
23554,CunninLynguists,It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
23555,CunninLynguists,Hittin and bullwhippin you leavin them slits in your back
23556,CunninLynguists,But Ive been a lucky one loving parents loving friends
23557,CunninLynguists,But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
23558,CunninLynguists,But I aint a genius on it I can only pretend
23559,CunninLynguists,Cause over all its an emotion I cannot comprehend
23560,CunninLynguists,Love aint the basis for action
23561,CunninLynguists,In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
23562,CunninLynguists,Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
23563,CunninLynguists,Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
23564,CunninLynguists,And the past isnt felt as a match made in hell
23565,CunninLynguists,But rather its held as a latter day meld
23566,CunninLynguists,Of common mistakes and nice intentions
23567,CunninLynguists,But when false love retention is simply vice invention
23568,CunninLynguists,Its only right to mention the fights you get in
23569,CunninLynguists,Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
23570,CunninLynguists,So whats love really got to do with it 
23571,CunninLynguists,From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
23572,CunninLynguists,The truth isnt as eloquent so be intelligent
23573,CunninLynguists,Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of its irrelevant
23574,CunninLynguists,And that wordll fit like a glove if you dont get right
23575,CunninLynguists,Now live your life for the love or stop
23576,CunninLynguists, So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin 
23577,CunninLynguists, Yeah Why dont you rap for food then  
23578,CunninLynguists,Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef
23579,CunninLynguists,Similar to Christ  we got divine reps so tell me 
23580,CunninLynguists,If you know your gwan die  why step  
23581,CunninLynguists,Show no mercy  when bruising crews 
23582,CunninLynguists,You get hit with more bricks than New Jerus
23583,CunninLynguists, Riddles confusing fools like Confucian rules
23584,CunninLynguists, Cause most cats are more squared than Rubiks Cubes 
23585,CunninLynguists,We spit raps that are totally murderous
23586,CunninLynguists, The rhymes are like an anaconda serpent clutch 
23587,CunninLynguists,So check out how these herbs get touched
23588,CunninLynguists, Unless your broads giving us brains  nigga you aint servin us
23589,CunninLynguists, Deacon and Kno  cunning lynguists with stunning English
23590,CunninLynguists, Our true lies bring more pumps than Harry Renquist
23591,CunninLynguists, Every week with the best speech

23999,CunninLynguists,Burned bridges occurred from scriptin my words
24000,CunninLynguists,Word so Ill chisel a verse
24001,CunninLynguists,On these lie filled halls that Ive lived in and searched

24008,CunninLynguists,Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
24009,CunninLynguists,Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
24010,CunninLynguists,A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
24011,CunninLynguists,Life is like a lion and Im dying at its feet
24012,CunninLynguists,I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
24013,CunninLynguists,Ive seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B roll
24014,CunninLynguists,My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
24015,CunninLynguists,And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
24016,CunninLynguists,My memory banks the only thing I tend to rob
24017,CunninLynguists,And every time I phone the lob Im out of dodge
24018,CunninLynguists,Its hard on the boulevard and other clich s

24030,CunninLynguists,In a flood of shadow puppetry something in the air
24031,CunninLynguists,Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self aware
24032,CunninLynguists,Its recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
24033,CunninLynguists,Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
24034,CunninLynguists,Close encounters exacerbate his condition

24089,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24090,CunninLynguists,There was a time when I couldnt find energy
24091,CunninLynguists,The only person that was feelin me was Mrs Hennessy
24092,CunninLynguists,Its like life was pinnin me down
24093,CunninLynguists,I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
24094,CunninLynguists,You aint gonna be a rapper youre not a factor
24095,CunninLynguists,You just a Kentucky boy get yourself a tractor
24096,CunninLynguists,Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
24097,CunninLynguists,Thats when the liquor and weed became a need
24098,CunninLynguists,Self esteem was lower than snorkel cities
24099,CunninLynguists,Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel s titties
24100,CunninLynguists,Then as soon as I started getting some pride
24101,CunninLynguists,My sister hydroplaned and died on I   
24102,CunninLynguists,In a family full of pride house full of tears
24103,CunninLynguists,Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
24104,CunninLynguists,Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
24105,CunninLynguists,Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
24106,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24107,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24108,CunninLynguists,I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
24109,CunninLynguists,And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
24110,CunninLynguists,Cant grow fond of past memories
24111,CunninLynguists,Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
24112,CunninLynguists,Offended by the mental imagery
24113,CunninLynguists,And suggest livin in poverty was really meant for me
24114,CunninLynguists,Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
24115,CunninLynguists,Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
24116,CunninLynguists,I cant begin to see how to control the flash backs
24117,CunninLynguists,Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
24118,CunninLynguists,Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
24119,CunninLynguists,When I dont perceive what I feel I deserve
24120,CunninLynguists,Being slurred by those not livin in my position
24121,CunninLynguists,My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
24122,CunninLynguists,And when I thought Id risen life freezes the frame
24123,CunninLynguists,So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain
24124,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24125,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24126,CunninLynguists,I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
24127,CunninLynguists,Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
24128,CunninLynguists,You know what blasphemys like cursing at God
24129,CunninLynguists,Cause you aint got shit it hurts and its hard
24130,CunninLynguists,Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
24131,CunninLynguists,Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
24132,CunninLynguists,Most of my lifes a daze got me forever lighting haze
24133,CunninLynguists,Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
24134,CunninLynguists,For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
24135,CunninLynguists,Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
24136,CunninLynguists,Few friends even then most homies is fake
24137,CunninLynguists,Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
24138,CunninLynguists,I went from the block with my fam to college exams
24139,CunninLynguists,But the pressures still there dog Im still scared
24140,CunninLynguists,But I know it will all be right in the end
24141,CunninLynguists,As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen
24142,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24143,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory

24261,CunninLynguists,They cant even come face to face and share smiles
24262,CunninLynguists,Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
24263,CunninLynguists,Like she spawned a fucking anti Christ or a Satan infant
24264,CunninLynguists,Blatant mentions about family blood wont leave
24265,CunninLynguists,Loves her deeply but evil sends its opposite feed
24266,CunninLynguists,Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
24267,CunninLynguists,If he could just set it aside thered be heaven to pay
24268,CunninLynguists,Then weathered and aged time swept him to grave
24269,CunninLynguists,Love conquers all shit Id say that areas grey
24270,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why   X 
24271,CunninLynguists,Most dont even know why they believe what they believe man

24276,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24277,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg
24278,CunninLynguists,Looking at life in retrospect its hard to regret
24279,CunninLynguists,Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
24280,CunninLynguists,Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
24281,CunninLynguists,Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
24282,CunninLynguists,And even though nobodys life is ever perfect
24283,CunninLynguists,You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
24284,CunninLynguists,Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
24285,CunninLynguists,Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
24286,CunninLynguists,People who pimp children are really raping religion
24287,CunninLynguists,The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
24288,CunninLynguists,But now the technology follows me solemnly
24289,CunninLynguists,Building the future laws to my philosophy
24290,CunninLynguists,Alzheimers cutting through like a lobotomy
24291,CunninLynguists,Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
24292,CunninLynguists,Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
24293,CunninLynguists,I survived disease and political crisis
24294,CunninLynguists,By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
24295,CunninLynguists,And now I live vicariously through my kids
24296,CunninLynguists,Like people who love the sport but cant play for shit
24297,CunninLynguists,Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
24298,CunninLynguists,I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
24299,CunninLynguists,Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
24300,CunninLynguists,But just before I vanish as I think Im at the end
24301,CunninLynguists,The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
24302,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24303,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24304,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24305,CunninLynguists,The world is changing day to day
24306,CunninLynguists,It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
24307,CunninLynguists,Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
24308,CunninLynguists,Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
24309,CunninLynguists,I feel weathered but feel like Ive been driving forever
24310,CunninLynguists,Showin up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
24311,CunninLynguists,Ive been better but all things pass
24312,CunninLynguists,This life is taking everything away but youre provided with your past
24313,CunninLynguists,So fuck it  I stick to having dreams on the road
24314,CunninLynguists,But until this dream is done Im gonna keep my eyes closed
24315,CunninLynguists,And breathe breathe when it snows
24316,CunninLynguists,Breathe when Im forced to live a life with a person on a phone
24317,CunninLynguists,Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin
24318,CunninLynguists,Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
24319,CunninLynguists,Cause after the show when the last star shines
24320,CunninLynguists,I can make this all better when I close my eyes
24321,CunninLynguists,Im in another zone where troubles gone
24322,CunninLynguists,Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
24323,CunninLynguists,A place where life is easy for everybody else
24324,CunninLynguists,I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
24325,CunninLynguists,But we dont know it where we dont show it all
24326,CunninLynguists,For life aint protocol under sky over law
24327,CunninLynguists,Im in another space where all the food is good
24328,CunninLynguists,And theres enough for everybody in my neighborhood
24329,CunninLynguists,Where all the grass is blue where we dont know bout green
24330,CunninLynguists,Cause money aint a thing I pinch myself its not a dream
24331,CunninLynguists,Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
24332,CunninLynguists,If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldnt mean a thing
24333,CunninLynguists,Between climbing and finding it not worth it
24334,CunninLynguists,Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
24335,CunninLynguists,Im so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
24336,CunninLynguists,I think of home when I close my eyes
24337,CunninLynguists,So done with the smokes and fries
24338,CunninLynguists,Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
24339,CunninLynguists,Drinks I shouldnt drink things I never write
24340,CunninLynguists,Cities I never liked now its like aight
24341,CunninLynguists,Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
24342,CunninLynguists,Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
24343,CunninLynguists,My work is love no complaints Im fine
24344,CunninLynguists,Its been a long night cant wait to close my eyes
24345,CunninLynguists,I dream of an industry ego less
24346,CunninLynguists,And free from the modern chains with these chains were so deep in love
24347,CunninLynguists,Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
24348,CunninLynguists,Dreaming a publicist wasnt  Gs a month
24349,CunninLynguists,And where its not about numbers and math
24350,CunninLynguists,And I was content with really just a couple of fans
24351,CunninLynguists,And my happiness wasnt relying on tours and a van
24352,CunninLynguists,Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
24353,CunninLynguists,With the front front row stadium packed
24354,CunninLynguists,And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
24355,CunninLynguists,And scream at them  Look at me now look at me man 
24356,CunninLynguists,Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
24357,CunninLynguists,Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
24358,CunninLynguists,Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
24359,CunninLynguists,I woke up and realized it was a dream
24360,CunninLynguists,Wide awake in the rap game but life Im asleep
24361,CunninLynguists,You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
24362,CunninLynguists,I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
24363,CunninLynguists,Part of my shine comes from the distance
24364,CunninLynguists,You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
24365,CunninLynguists,Is this business emotionally invested 
24366,CunninLynguists,Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
24367,CunninLynguists,Love is war sex is a weapon
24368,CunninLynguists,The mind is a mine so watch where youre steppin
24369,CunninLynguists,Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
24370,CunninLynguists,Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
24371,CunninLynguists,Feelings are just filling in this half baked scene
24372,CunninLynguists,To make x rated into nc   
24373,CunninLynguists,Then see everything she got she not shy
24374,CunninLynguists,Our love below so dro we most high
24375,CunninLynguists,Then wears off when what we wears on
24376,CunninLynguists,Again I turn away when what we shares gone
24377,CunninLynguists,If this is not the hardest part
24378,CunninLynguists,If passion dies within routine
24379,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared
24380,CunninLynguists,Could have been fearless and unprepared
24381,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared

24386,CunninLynguists,Whatever happens after this moments of no concern
24387,CunninLynguists,But its hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
24388,CunninLynguists,Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
24389,CunninLynguists,We wired for desire dangers to ourselves
24390,CunninLynguists,Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
24391,CunninLynguists,My muse sleeps deep within time
24392,CunninLynguists,I go to her for credit though I need to decline
24393,CunninLynguists,Its easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
24394,CunninLynguists,Im sorry its just the way we designed

24408,CunninLynguists,I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
24409,CunninLynguists,Cause when youre gone its just that coffin that you lie stiff in

24412,CunninLynguists,That I made when I was younger way before the hunger
24413,CunninLynguists,Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number

24955,CunninLynguists,From them days in the park alone drinking gin by the cup
24956,CunninLynguists,Through an exitless maze wandering and constantly stuck

24958,CunninLynguists,Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
24959,CunninLynguists,Wasnt selfish with them trying to stretch and contort them
24960,CunninLynguists,And didnt let the world get to them first and distort them
24961,CunninLynguists,So as I  kick back and ponder on armeggedon
24962,CunninLynguists,And I   spit raps about where my life couldve been headin

24972,CunninLynguists,So I dont see that all my enemies resembled me
24973,CunninLynguists,Im feeling faceless heading for a bitter state

25105,CunninLynguists,Like everythings changed and suddenly you dont trust her just the same
25106,CunninLynguists,Then you find out some other mans been fuckin out her brains
25107,CunninLynguists,Thats when your heart starts to feel the pain
25108,CunninLynguists,So much that you can feel it in your veins and you cant forget her name

25121,CunninLynguists,And all of them know Ive never felt this pain in my past
25122,CunninLynguists,And its ironic the first place we made loves the same as the last
25123,CunninLynguists,In the shower    thats why I put the rain with her name
25124,CunninLynguists,And my power to trust someone again has faded away

25126,CunninLynguists,I wallow in my sorrow smoke and watch tapes that we made
25127,CunninLynguists,And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades

25143,CunninLynguists,Many stems like hymns once blossomed from ground
25144,CunninLynguists,But while the reaper is king we carry the crown
25145,CunninLynguists,We weigh it out dreaming screaming or close to even
25146,CunninLynguists,In this sense nobodys perfect nobody is worthless
25147,CunninLynguists,The systems imperfect maybe we should measure in purpose

25160,CunninLynguists,Faith we treat it like a four letter word

25162,CunninLynguists,Hear me my Lord come settle my nerves
25163,CunninLynguists,I pray these words bring honor as the heavens observe
25164,CunninLynguists,And to the sky where the birds will testify

25705,CunninLynguists,Throwing change ups in your medley through headpiece
25706,CunninLynguists,Still Judge but dont Dredd each day instead feast
25707,CunninLynguists,Lifes an unfed beast that eats bread and meat
25708,CunninLynguists,Thats either your cash or your corpse

25710,CunninLynguists,I am floating happy not knowing nautical course
25711,CunninLynguists,Tie a wristwatch in slipknots and dock at my porch
25712,CunninLynguists,Time is of no essence the presence becomes presents
25713,CunninLynguists,Peasants become pheasants and soar past acceptance
25714,CunninLynguists,Current currencies worthless fodder for feeding purses
25715,CunninLynguists,With iron clad words I solder together verses
25716,CunninLynguists,I m trippin like I m eatin the fungi
25717,CunninLynguists,Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye
25718,CunninLynguists,Theres no light just never ending night
25719,CunninLynguists,And the weathers like a hurricane when land is in its sight
25720,CunninLynguists,The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
25721,CunninLynguists,And Im trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
25722,CunninLynguists,From the motions of the sea to the color of the dark
25723,CunninLynguists,This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
25724,CunninLynguists,Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
25725,CunninLynguists,I wonder as I wander through my heart
25726,CunninLynguists,Cus it starts a dream defferred
25727,CunninLynguists,A clipped wing on a white dove
25728,CunninLynguists,Seems absurd a smudge on a white glove
25729,CunninLynguists,Not seen nor heard like screams from the nights lungs
25730,CunninLynguists,Cling to words so much that you wont budge
25731,CunninLynguists,Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
25732,CunninLynguists,Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
25733,CunninLynguists,It hits your mind with the right stuff
25734,CunninLynguists,To keep you blind with a slight buzz
25735,CunninLynguists,The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
25736,CunninLynguists,We scuffle through its pieces strugglin for peace its
25737,CunninLynguists,Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
25738,CunninLynguists,The image in my mirror s gettin harder to relate
25739,CunninLynguists,I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
25740,CunninLynguists,But I couldnt be farther from my faith or my face
25741,CunninLynguists,Through this waste of my mind may I find direction
25742,CunninLynguists,Im a waste of my time if I dont find its lessons
25743,CunninLynguists,So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
25744,CunninLynguists,Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
25745,CunninLynguists,As the world twirls on the tip of our index
25746,CunninLynguists,Staring into space one s vision is endless
25747,CunninLynguists,But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is
25748,CunninLynguists,So just close pupils and be pupils and listen
25749,CunninLynguists,The headset s your desk the test is what s missin
25750,CunninLynguists,Disect these notes of quotes of keys written
25751,CunninLynguists,Dont worry about this dirty south til its mud floods ya front stoop
25752,CunninLynguists,Aces and acres of haters growing out the same root
25753,CunninLynguists,That hit you quicker than poverty in two major arteries
25754,CunninLynguists,Havin you movin and softshoe in like who made you property
25755,CunninLynguists,Black face and sambos tied for last place
25756,CunninLynguists,Let facts state we like Wildcats in a rat race
25757,CunninLynguists,At that rate the state stay ahead of tomorrow
25758,CunninLynguists,Standing out like mount Kilimanjaro
25759,CunninLynguists,So through this Bluegrass follow sorrow
25760,CunninLynguists,Blacker then the ghetto you fear
25761,CunninLynguists,You disappear like the future of the ghetto you near
25762,CunninLynguists,Where index fingers bring the heavy metal you hear
25763,CunninLynguists,Block stars loading guns as fiends battle for crumbs
25764,CunninLynguists,Come travel through slums try politickin with pushas
25765,CunninLynguists,Made block decisions while mothafuckas overlooked us
25766,CunninLynguists,Under the radar like helicopters on the sly

25795,CunninLynguists,Unless he builds with a female until time stands still
25796,CunninLynguists,When we take off our shells and chill
25797,CunninLynguists,All before fingers learn bodies like we got blindman skill
25798,CunninLynguists,She speaks no evil but says whatever
25799,CunninLynguists,After Shaking up bed feathers still prays together

25837,CunninLynguists,Of those in this winter with no mink or folk
25838,CunninLynguists,Weathering this desert with no drink to cope
25839,CunninLynguists,Some chain smoke with no link or hope
25840,CunninLynguists,You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
25841,CunninLynguists,The fastest can t run from who they are
25842,CunninLynguists,I d run from self but no man can run that far
25843,CunninLynguists,Turn the page eventually I hit a certain age
25844,CunninLynguists,Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you re afraid
25845,CunninLynguists,Success can often be a perfect cage
25846,CunninLynguists,Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
25847,CunninLynguists,A prisoner trapped in the regret

25859,CunninLynguists,I m Bustin Loose no Wilder just a Pryor  prior 
25860,CunninLynguists,And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
25861,CunninLynguists,Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
25862,CunninLynguists,Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
25863,CunninLynguists,Meet a fan kick it witcha take a picture
25864,CunninLynguists,Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister

25875,CunninLynguists,If it would help I d even die for you
25876,CunninLynguists,I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
25877,CunninLynguists,Over against my own will surrounded by illusions
25878,CunninLynguists,Fighting to stay positive however losing
25879,CunninLynguists,Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
25880,CunninLynguists,The human heart does more than just pump blood
25881,CunninLynguists,It pumps love at least I know that mine did once
25882,CunninLynguists,But a large piece of it was undone
25883,CunninLynguists,And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
25884,CunninLynguists,Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
25885,CunninLynguists,Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
25886,CunninLynguists,But be certain of your faith and you ll acquire the ability
25887,CunninLynguists,To expose witches and burn them at the stake
25888,CunninLynguists,I m looking for love I m done searching for a date
25889,CunninLynguists,Ive been alone for years but it s worth it if you wait
25890,CunninLynguists,Personally late s better than never at all
25891,CunninLynguists,So when I brush myself off whenever I fall tell me
25892,CunninLynguists,Oh yeah That s what the last one said
25893,CunninLynguists,Unfortunately I was mad misled
25894,CunninLynguists,I ran on E til no more gas was left
25895,CunninLynguists,The most I got from her was ass and bread
25896,CunninLynguists,But trust was lost like Kanye s fashion sense
25897,CunninLynguists,Accidents happen when you live with the weak
25898,CunninLynguists,But it s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
25899,CunninLynguists,That s enough reason to get into beef
25900,CunninLynguists,Throw all your spouse s shit on the street quit  retreat
25901,CunninLynguists,But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
25902,CunninLynguists,So please for my sake stay by me this earth is cold
25903,CunninLynguists,And I m freezing like I ve been lying in dirt and snow
25904,CunninLynguists,I ve searched the globe for a person who knows
25905,CunninLynguists,The true meaning of love you could be the one
25906,CunninLynguists,If you mean what you say we could link up
25907,CunninLynguists,And use what we learned from our exes in the past
25908,CunninLynguists,But wait cause I got another question to ask and that s 
25909,CunninLynguists,Sounds good and if you mean it I ll hook up with you this evening
25910,CunninLynguists,Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
25911,CunninLynguists,The touch of a king when you re my queen
25912,CunninLynguists,And trust is the the key in every relationship
25913,CunninLynguists,But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
25914,CunninLynguists,But looks can be deceiving
25915,CunninLynguists,Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
25916,CunninLynguists,So don t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
25917,CunninLynguists,That s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
25918,CunninLynguists,But the first line of this song already explained
25919,CunninLynguists,That my arteries were drained now all of me is tame
25920,CunninLynguists,So stay beside me cause I don t wanna be estranged
25921,CunninLynguists,As soon as time found them they were saved
25922,CunninLynguists,And still lay there to this day
25923,CunninLynguists,But if this should ever change
25924,CunninLynguists,Just stay and I mma do the same
25925,CunninLynguists,The darkness of the night has gone

25946,CunninLynguists,No brown on the streets where baristas rule
25947,CunninLynguists,And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
25948,CunninLynguists,For the tenants thats in it
25949,CunninLynguists,But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
25950,CunninLynguists,To a brand new prison they can sit til the bars are all  gone 
25951,CunninLynguists,They trying to get us out the hood them people want us  gone 
25952,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone 
25953,CunninLynguists,Crack a Corona just zone while Im sipping on it

25962,CunninLynguists,But their Innocence is  gone 
25963,CunninLynguists,And what are we to teach them 
25964,CunninLynguists,When all the grannies are beneath them
25965,CunninLynguists,And the families are divided
25966,CunninLynguists,Searching but I ve been told the silver lining is  gone 
25967,CunninLynguists,This is when fear talks ears off
25968,CunninLynguists,Many corporations calculate what a tear cost
25969,CunninLynguists,Morals break down like they biodegradable
25970,CunninLynguists,Too keep the faith or give it up
25971,CunninLynguists,Are the lights that shine in the darkest times  Gone 
25972,CunninLynguists,I m hoping this as bad as it gets
25973,CunninLynguists,They trying to kick us out the hood niggas want us  gone

26277,CunninLynguists,With Jesus seeking redemption but he dont want my repentance
26278,CunninLynguists,For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
26279,CunninLynguists,Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
26280,CunninLynguists,The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessings
26281,CunninLynguists,Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
26282,CunninLynguists,Parents repeatedly sentenced heroin needles on dressers
26283,CunninLynguists,They use to feed their infection I cant repeat indescretions
26284,CunninLynguists,So I pause for reflection long for honest affection
26285,CunninLynguists,And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
26286,CunninLynguists,If you knew where my head is when Im doing these records

26307,CunninLynguists,If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
26308,CunninLynguists,It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
26309,CunninLynguists,Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
26310,CunninLynguists,When they was on the air I was on the pause button
26311,CunninLynguists,I had the best taste but I aint trying to cause nothing

26315,CunninLynguists,Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
26316,CunninLynguists,Having the best tapes was like a status symbol
26317,CunninLynguists,The yellow tape purple tape to the baddest demo

26554,CunninLynguists,They keep piping in elevator music

39382,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39383,Eminem,I went in headfirst never thinkin about who what I said hurt
39384,Eminem,In what verse my mom probably got it the worst
39385,Eminem,The brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did I take it too far 
39386,Eminem, Cleanin Out My Closet and all them other songs
39387,Eminem,But regardless I dont hate you  cause Ma
39388,Eminem,Youre still beautiful to me  cause youre my mom
39389,Eminem,Though far be it from you to be calm
39390,Eminem,Our house was Vietnam Desert Storm
39391,Eminem,And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
39392,Eminem,Equivalent to chemical warfare
39393,Eminem,And forever we could drag this on and on
39394,Eminem,But agree to disagree that gift for me
39395,Eminem,Up under the Christmas tree dont mean shit to me
39396,Eminem,Youre kickin me out Its   degrees
39397,Eminem,And its Christmas Eve  Little prick just leave  
39398,Eminem,Ma let me grab my fucking coat 
39399,Eminem,Anything to have each others goats
39400,Eminem,Why we always at each others throats 
39401,Eminem,Especially when Dad he fucked us both
39402,Eminem,Were in the same fuckin boat
39403,Eminem,Youd think thatd make us close  nope 
39404,Eminem,Further away it drove us but together headlights shine
39405,Eminem,And a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
39406,Eminem,Back to grandmas house its straight up the road
39407,Eminem,And I was the man of the house the oldest
39408,Eminem,So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
39409,Eminem,Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
39410,Eminem,And thats when I realized you were sick
39411,Eminem,And it wasnt fixable or changeable
39412,Eminem,And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though but 
39413,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39414,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39415,Eminem, Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
39416,Eminem, Cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
39417,Eminem,But Im sorry Momma for  Cleanin Out My Closet 
39418,Eminem,At the time I was angry rightfully Maybe so
39419,Eminem,Never meant that far to take it though
39420,Eminem, Cause now I know its not your fault and Im not makin jokes
39421,Eminem,That song I no longer play at shows
39422,Eminem,And I cringe every time its on the radio
39423,Eminem,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
39424,Eminem,And all the medicine you fed us and
39425,Eminem,How I just wanted you to taste your own
39426,Eminem,But now the medications takin over
39427,Eminem,And your mental states deterioratin slow
39428,Eminem,And Im way too old to cry the shit is painful though
39429,Eminem,But Ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo
39430,Eminem,All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
39431,Eminem,Foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
39432,Eminem,But I love you Debbie Mathers
39433,Eminem,Oh what a tangled web we have  cause
39434,Eminem,One thing I never asked was
39435,Eminem,Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
39436,Eminem,Fuck it I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
39437,Eminem,But Ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
39438,Eminem,Owned a collection of maps
39439,Eminem,And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
39440,Eminem,If someone ever moved em from me
39441,Eminem,That you coulda bet your asses
39442,Eminem,If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap em
39443,Eminem,And although one has only met their grandma once
39444,Eminem,You pulled up in our drive one night
39445,Eminem,As we were leavin to get some hamburgers
39446,Eminem,Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you
39447,Eminem,And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
39448,Eminem,Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
39449,Eminem,I saw your headlights as I looked back
39450,Eminem,And Im mad I didnt get the chance to
39451,Eminem,Thank you for being my mom and my dad
39452,Eminem,So Mom please accept this as a
39453,Eminem,Tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to
39454,Eminem,Get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to
39455,Eminem,Lay it fore Im dead the stewardess said to fasten
39456,Eminem,My seatbelt I guess were crashin
39457,Eminem,So if Im not dreamin I hope you get this message that
39458,Eminem,I will always love you from afar  cause youre my mom
39459,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39460,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39461,Eminem,I want a new life  start over 
39462,Eminem,One without a cause  clean slate 
39463,Eminem,Well no matter what the cost
39464,Eminem,And if the plane goes down
39465,Eminem,Or if the crew cant wake me up
39466,Eminem,Well just know that Im alright
39467,Eminem,Oh even if theres songs to sing
39468,Eminem,Well my children will carry me
39469,Eminem,Because I put my faith in my little girls
39470,Eminem,So I never say goodbye cruel world
39471,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39472,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39473,Eminem,Cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak  Yo left yo left yo left right left 
39474,Eminem,And when you feel weak  Yo left 
39475,Eminem,You feel like you wanna just give up  Yo left yo left 
39476,Eminem,But you gotta search within you  Right left 
39477,Eminem,Tryna find that inner strength  Yo left yo left 
39478,Eminem,And just pull that shit out of you  Yo left 
39479,Eminem,And get that motivation to not give up  Right left yo left 
39480,Eminem,And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall  Yo left yo left 
39481,Eminem,Flat on your face and collapse  Right left 
39482,Eminem,Til I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em
39483,Eminem,Til the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
39484,Eminem, Cause when I am not then Ima stop pennin em
39485,Eminem,And I am not hip hop and Im just not Eminem
39486,Eminem,Subliminal thoughts when Ima stop sendin em 
39487,Eminem,Women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom
39488,Eminem,Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
39489,Eminem,Amoxicillins just not real enough
39490,Eminem,The criminal cop killin hip hop villain
39491,Eminem,A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
39492,Eminem,Youre comin with me feel it or not
39493,Eminem,Youre gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
39494,Eminem,You hear it a lot lyrics to shock
39495,Eminem,Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up 
39496,Eminem,Fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up
39497,Eminem,You bizzels forgot Slizzel does not give a fuck
39498,Eminem,Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39499,Eminem,Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39500,Eminem,Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39501,Eminem,Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39502,Eminem, Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39503,Eminem, The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39504,Eminem, Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39505,Eminem, Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39506,Eminem,Music is like magic theres a certain feelin you get
39507,Eminem,When you real and you spit and people are feelin your shit
39508,Eminem,This is your moment and every single minute you spend
39509,Eminem,Tryna hold on to it cause you may never get it again
39510,Eminem,So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
39511,Eminem,And when your run is over just admit when its at its end
39512,Eminem,Cause Im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
39513,Eminem,I got a list heres the order of my list that its in
39514,Eminem,It goes Reggie JayZ  Pac and Biggie
39515,Eminem,Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me
39516,Eminem,But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy
39517,Eminem,So when Im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
39518,Eminem,Thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me
39519,Eminem,Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
39520,Eminem,You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
39521,Eminem,The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney  Nate hit me 
39522,Eminem,Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39523,Eminem,Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39524,Eminem,Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39525,Eminem,Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39526,Eminem, Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39527,Eminem, The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39528,Eminem, Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39529,Eminem, Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39530,Eminem,Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart
39531,Eminem,What is he thinking How not to go against me smart
39532,Eminem,And its absurd how people hang on every word
39533,Eminem,Ill probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
39534,Eminem,But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
39535,Eminem,If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
39536,Eminem, Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse
39537,Eminem,Thats why Im clever when I put together every verse
39538,Eminem,My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
39539,Eminem,I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
39540,Eminem,But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
39541,Eminem,The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
39542,Eminem,So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin at em
39543,Eminem,The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static 
39544,Eminem, Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters
39545,Eminem,A plaque and platinum status is whack if Im not the baddest so
39546,Eminem,Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39547,Eminem,Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth

39550,Eminem, Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39551,Eminem, The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39552,Eminem, Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39553,Eminem, Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39554,Eminem,Until the roof  until the roof 
39555,Eminem,The roof comes off  the roof comes off 
39556,Eminem,Until my legs  until my legs

40008,Eminem,That I may be done with rap I need a new outlet

40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club

40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40376,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40377,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear

40381,Eminem,And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
40382,Eminem,But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you

40681,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
40709,Eminem,This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business

40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
40733,Eminem,But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
40734,Eminem,That we just inherited   s beef with Murder Inc

40737,Eminem,Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
40738,Eminem,Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
40748,Eminem,Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
40749,Eminem,Off at your jaws well then I can  cause frankly Im sick of talkin
40750,Eminem,Im not goin to let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience
40751,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart

41198,Eminem,Is more than twice than a black life span
41199,Eminem,I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
41200,Eminem,I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
41201,Eminem,Id rather hear em say  Die N word than Die Antwoord
41202,Eminem,Ninja now its better disguised banter
41203,Eminem,But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
41204,Eminem,Were applying but McDonalds
41205,Eminem,Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
41206,Eminem,So how can we have higher standards 
41207,Eminem,As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
41208,Eminem,We fight back with violence but acts like that are
41209,Eminem,Black eyes on the movement
41210,Eminem,Which makes black lives madder
41211,Eminem,Thats why its at a stalemate
41212,Eminem,And cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops
41213,Eminem,I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
41214,Eminem,The block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
41215,Eminem,Call the attack dogs off of us man
41216,Eminem,You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop

41219,Eminem,Who aint acclimated to em like thats the way to do it
41220,Eminem,Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns
41221,Eminem,And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
41222,Eminem,And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
41223,Eminem,Wait why are there black neighborhoods 
41224,Eminem,Cause America segregated us designated us to an area
41225,Eminem,Separated us Section Eightd us
41226,Eminem,When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
41227,Eminem,And education sucks and every days another
41228,Eminem,Freddie Gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
41229,Eminem,Why is it they treat us like dryer lint 
41230,Eminem,We just want a safe environment for our kids
41231,Eminem,But can t escape the sirens
41232,Eminem,Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
41233,Eminem,The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
41234,Eminem,The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
41235,Eminem,And we re trapped in these racial biases
41236,Eminem,That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
41237,Eminem,Every time we see a devil s face
41238,Eminem,Lions tigers and bears oh my
41239,Eminem,Its more like billy clubs and gats
41240,Eminem,And we really love it when you think we re guilty  cause we re black
41241,Eminem, But you kill each other facts
41242,Eminem,You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats 
41243,Eminem,Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
41244,Eminem,While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
41245,Eminem,Fuck your Republican views
41246,Eminem,Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots 
41247,Eminem,And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
41248,Eminem,Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
41249,Eminem,You better be strapped with a derringer
41250,Eminem,Or be  capped in America like Steve Rogers
41251,Eminem,Cause no one oversees these cops and
41252,Eminem,All we see is em beat charges
41253,Eminem,We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
41254,Eminem,So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
41255,Eminem,Just keep marchin til we reach congress
41256,Eminem,But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
41257,Eminem,If you try to slander the flag but
41258,Eminem,Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
41259,Eminem,So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
41260,Eminem,If you dont stand for the national anthem
41261,Eminem,We raise it you better praise it
41262,Eminem,Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
41263,Eminem,Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
41264,Eminem,Home of the brave is still racist ville
41265,Eminem,So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
41266,Eminem,In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
41267,Eminem,That had its Natives killed
41268,Eminem,Got you singin this star spangled spiel

47474,Ice Cube,How to survive in South Central  what you do  
47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive
