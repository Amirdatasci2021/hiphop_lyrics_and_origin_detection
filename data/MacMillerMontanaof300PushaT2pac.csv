87854,Mac Miller,So it was so very easy to be together and look forward to being together and our love affair just blossomed the more we saw each other and the more we were together we learned more and more about each other After a short period of time we became engaged and had a very small intimate wedding with just family and very close friends the friends we continued to have for the rest of our life and then came two adorable little boys And   my husband just adored my daughter and adored the two boys and I feel I just gave him a wonderful life A good marriage and a wonderful family and I know he really had a beautiful life and I did too And how important it is to love respect and care for each other
