79892,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79893,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79894,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
79925,Logic,Just like you the person I wrote this for
79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
79928,Logic,And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
79929,Logic,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
79930,Logic,We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
79931,Logic,We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
79932,Logic,Starting with mental health
79933,Logic,We will accept ourselves as we are
79934,Logic,And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror

80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

81895,Logic,Martin without the Gina Venus without Serena
81896,Logic,Now these thirsty bitches on the dick we call that Aquafina
81897,Logic,I used to bus tables until them tables turned
81898,Logic,And everything I have obtained is everything Ive earned
81899,Logic,And everything I rap about is everything Ive learned
81900,Logic,So hopefully the listener can position a situation where they dont get burned
81901,Logic,And they can learn from my mistakes like Ive learned from the greats
81902,Logic,To do whatever it takes for Heavens sakes open your mind
81903,Logic,This shits one of a kind elegant and refined irrelevant to the swine
81904,Logic,Whipping through LA in the coupe de Ville on the real
81905,Logic,To various people I do appeal because of skill
81906,Logic,So this the type of shit Im gon keep making

81913,Logic,Cause all you wack rappers couldnt break change to make sense
81914,Logic,Im back again with another argument about how much Im black again
81915,Logic,Fighting for credibility from the lack of blacker skin
81916,Logic,Its kind of funny how your pigment determines how people perceive you
81917,Logic,Aint seen my momma in a minute
81918,Logic,Cause growing up she called me a nigga
81919,Logic,That would never amount to nothing

81926,Logic,Never once did you feel the pain of my stomach
81927,Logic,That manifested from the lack of meals
81928,Logic,Headed to the soup kitchen on foot by the lack of wheels
81929,Logic,And hell no we aint never missing
81930,Logic,Came a long way from eating when government gave permission

81938,Logic,Drop the politics and bring us together again
81939,Logic,Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then
81940,Logic,Maybe if I go platinum theyll remember me then yeah yeah
81941,Logic,But Im not defined by the sales of my first week
81942,Logic,Cause in my mind the only way I fail if my verse weak
81943,Logic,As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
81944,Logic,Compiled of different races gathering from different places
81945,Logic,I just contemplate shout out to those who can relate
81946,Logic,And even though it gets hard I know my fate
81947,Logic,With my train of thought racing like a runaway freight
81948,Logic,Living life to the fullest until I hit up them gates its like
