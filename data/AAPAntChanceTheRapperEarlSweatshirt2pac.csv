125045,2pac, did you hear  did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete provin natures laws wrong it learned to walk without having feet funny it seems but by keeping its dreams it learned to breathe fresh air long live the rose that grew from concrete when no one else even cared 
125046,2pac, keepin all these dreams provin natures laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet  to breathe the fresh air it came from concrete  to breathe the fresh air  to breathe the fresh air to breathe the fresh air
