39514,Eminem,It goes Reggie JayZ  Pac and Biggie
39515,Eminem,Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me

39534,Eminem,But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
39535,Eminem,If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
39536,Eminem, Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse

39538,Eminem,My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
39539,Eminem,I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
39540,Eminem,But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
39541,Eminem,The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
39542,Eminem,So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin at em
39543,Eminem,The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static 
39544,Eminem, Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters

39947,Eminem,And at the time every house that we lived in
39948,Eminem,Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
39949,Eminem,And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
39950,Eminem,Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
39951,Eminem,Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
39952,Eminem,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
39953,Eminem,And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart

39955,Eminem,On to Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
39956,Eminem,And Dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
39957,Eminem,And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
39958,Eminem,And met Dr Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
39959,Eminem,But Daddy had to work you and Momma had to leave me
39960,Eminem,Then you started seein Daddy on the TV and Momma didnt like it
39961,Eminem,And you and Lainie were too young to understand it

39963,Eminem,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
39964,Eminem,Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

40004,Eminem,Im starting to feel distant again
40005,Eminem,So I decided just to pick this pen
40006,Eminem,Up and try to make an attempt to vent
40007,Eminem,But I just cant admit or come to grips with the fact
40008,Eminem,That I may be done with rap I need a new outlet
40009,Eminem,And I know some shits so hard to swallow
40010,Eminem,But I just cant sit back and wallow

40118,Eminem,Thinkin he can try and solve em
40119,Eminem,Im outside chalkin up drawings
40120,Eminem,On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin

40135,Eminem,I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
40136,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
40137,Eminem, Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind bogglin
40138,Eminem, Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit

40151,Eminem,What about them rhymes Ive been jottin 
40152,Eminem,They are kind of giving me confidence
40153,Eminem,Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
40154,Eminem,Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx 
40155,Eminem,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that

40233,Eminem,But I think Im still tryin to figure this crap out
40234,Eminem,Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
40235,Eminem,This fuckin black cloud still follows me around
40236,Eminem,But its time to exorcise these demons

40251,Eminem,It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
40252,Eminem,Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
40253,Eminem,So I could come back a brand new me
40254,Eminem,And dont even realize what you did believe me you
40255,Eminem,Ive been through the wringer
40256,Eminem,But they can do little to the middle finger
40257,Eminem,I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
40258,Eminem,My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
40259,Eminem,And drop dead no more beef lingers
40260,Eminem,No more drama from now on I promise
40261,Eminem,To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
40262,Eminem,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
40265,Eminem,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
40266,Eminem,Id shoot for the moon but Im too busy gazin at stars
40267,Eminem,I m not afraid  I m not afraid

40273,Eminem,Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road
40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40376,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40377,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40378,Eminem,Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for

40680,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40681,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
40709,Eminem,This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
40710,Eminem,Im still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute  cause 
40711,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
40733,Eminem,But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
40734,Eminem,That we just inherited   s beef with Murder Inc

40736,Eminem,We still have soldiers thats on the front line
40737,Eminem,Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
40738,Eminem,Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
40748,Eminem,Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
40749,Eminem,Off at your jaws well then I can  cause frankly Im sick of talkin

41198,Eminem,Is more than twice than a black life span
41199,Eminem,I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
41200,Eminem,I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
41201,Eminem,Id rather hear em say  Die N word than Die Antwoord
41202,Eminem,Ninja now its better disguised banter
41203,Eminem,But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
41204,Eminem,Were applying but McDonalds
41205,Eminem,Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
41206,Eminem,So how can we have higher standards 
41207,Eminem,As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
41208,Eminem,We fight back with violence but acts like that are
41209,Eminem,Black eyes on the movement
41210,Eminem,Which makes black lives madder
41211,Eminem,Thats why its at a stalemate
41212,Eminem,And cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops
41213,Eminem,I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
41214,Eminem,The block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
41215,Eminem,Call the attack dogs off of us man
41216,Eminem,You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop

41220,Eminem,Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns
41221,Eminem,And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
41222,Eminem,And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
41223,Eminem,Wait why are there black neighborhoods 
41224,Eminem,Cause America segregated us designated us to an area
41225,Eminem,Separated us Section Eightd us
41226,Eminem,When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
41227,Eminem,And education sucks and every days another
41228,Eminem,Freddie Gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
41229,Eminem,Why is it they treat us like dryer lint 
41230,Eminem,We just want a safe environment for our kids
41231,Eminem,But can t escape the sirens
41232,Eminem,Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
41233,Eminem,The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
41234,Eminem,The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
41235,Eminem,And we re trapped in these racial biases
41236,Eminem,That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
41237,Eminem,Every time we see a devil s face
41238,Eminem,Lions tigers and bears oh my
41239,Eminem,Its more like billy clubs and gats
41240,Eminem,And we really love it when you think we re guilty  cause we re black
41241,Eminem, But you kill each other facts
41242,Eminem,You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats 
41243,Eminem,Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
41244,Eminem,While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
41245,Eminem,Fuck your Republican views
41246,Eminem,Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots 
41247,Eminem,And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
41248,Eminem,Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
41249,Eminem,You better be strapped with a derringer
41250,Eminem,Or be  capped in America like Steve Rogers
41251,Eminem,Cause no one oversees these cops and
41252,Eminem,All we see is em beat charges
41253,Eminem,We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
41254,Eminem,So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
41255,Eminem,Just keep marchin til we reach congress
41256,Eminem,But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
41257,Eminem,If you try to slander the flag but
41258,Eminem,Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
41259,Eminem,So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
41260,Eminem,If you dont stand for the national anthem
41261,Eminem,We raise it you better praise it
41262,Eminem,Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
41263,Eminem,Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
41264,Eminem,Home of the brave is still racist ville
41265,Eminem,So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
41266,Eminem,In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
41267,Eminem,That had its Natives killed
41268,Eminem,Got you singin this star spangled spiel

70510,Kendrick Lamar,Back to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
70511,Kendrick Lamar,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
70512,Kendrick Lamar,Or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
70513,Kendrick Lamar,Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught

70520,Kendrick Lamar,Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
70521,Kendrick Lamar,And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great 
70522,Kendrick Lamar,A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
70523,Kendrick Lamar,Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
70524,Kendrick Lamar,Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
70525,Kendrick Lamar,And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get it or die tryin

70538,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70539,Kendrick Lamar,Sometimes I look in the mirror
70540,Kendrick Lamar,And ask myself Am I really scared of passin away 
70541,Kendrick Lamar,If its today I hope I hear a
70542,Kendrick Lamar,Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
70543,Kendrick Lamar,With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
70544,Kendrick Lamar,I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
70545,Kendrick Lamar,The scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
70546,Kendrick Lamar,With the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
70547,Kendrick Lamar,May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
70548,Kendrick Lamar,And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
70549,Kendrick Lamar,And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
70550,Kendrick Lamar,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
70551,Kendrick Lamar,That can come about  cause the tongue is mighty powerful
70552,Kendrick Lamar,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
70553,Kendrick Lamar,Maybe cause Im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
70554,Kendrick Lamar,Really stuck in the schema of wonderin when Ima rest

71246,Kendrick Lamar,Describing my world it says 
71247,Kendrick Lamar, The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
71248,Kendrick Lamar,Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
71249,Kendrick Lamar,In order to protect itself from this mad city
71250,Kendrick Lamar,While consuming its environment
71251,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
71252,Kendrick Lamar,One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
71258,Kendrick Lamar,Already surrounded by this mad city
71259,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
71260,Kendrick Lamar,Which institutionalizes him
71261,Kendrick Lamar,He can no longer see past his own thoughts
71262,Kendrick Lamar,When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
71263,Kendrick Lamar,Going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
71264,Kendrick Lamar,Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
71265,Kendrick Lamar,Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
71266,Kendrick Lamar,That the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
71267,Kendrick Lamar,Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
71268,Kendrick Lamar,They are one and the same

82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself

84386,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84387,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84388,Lupe Fiasco,With land on the horizon and passion in their eyes and
84389,Lupe Fiasco,What they think are islands are much more in their size and
84390,Lupe Fiasco,Bountiful and plentiful and resource to provide them
84391,Lupe Fiasco,Supplies slim morale once so heavily inside them
84392,Lupe Fiasco,Return is not an option as necessity denies them
84393,Lupe Fiasco,With this they choose to dive in
84394,Lupe Fiasco,Now along the shore and so aware of their arriving
84395,Lupe Fiasco,Are the children of this land prepared to share in their surviving
84396,Lupe Fiasco,A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
84397,Lupe Fiasco,Not the material things of kings that could never last forever
84398,Lupe Fiasco,But secrets of the spirit world and how to live in harmony together
84399,Lupe Fiasco,Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
84400,Lupe Fiasco,And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
84401,Lupe Fiasco,Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
84402,Lupe Fiasco,And so began it here And for five hundred years
84403,Lupe Fiasco,Torture terror fear til they nearly disappear
84404,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84405,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84406,Lupe Fiasco,Ways and means from the trade of human beings
84407,Lupe Fiasco,A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
84408,Lupe Fiasco,And helps the new regime establish and expand
84409,Lupe Fiasco,Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
84410,Lupe Fiasco,From native caretakers who can barely understand
84411,Lupe Fiasco,How can land be owned by another man 
84412,Lupe Fiasco,Warns  One can not steal what was given as a gift 
84413,Lupe Fiasco,Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish  
84414,Lupe Fiasco,But the lesson went unheeded for the sake of whats not needed
84415,Lupe Fiasco,You kill but do not eat it
84416,Lupe Fiasco,The excessive and elitists dont repair it when they leave it
84417,Lupe Fiasco,The forestss were cleared the factories were built
84418,Lupe Fiasco,And all mistakes will be repeated
84419,Lupe Fiasco,By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
84420,Lupe Fiasco,Foolishness and flaws greed and needs and disagreement
84421,Lupe Fiasco,And then you rush to have the most from the day you left your boats
84422,Lupe Fiasco,Youll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts
84423,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84424,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84425,Lupe Fiasco,As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
84426,Lupe Fiasco,A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
84427,Lupe Fiasco,They discover ancient cars on even older streets
84428,Lupe Fiasco,And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
84429,Lupe Fiasco,A culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth
84430,Lupe Fiasco,They can tell that they were civil not barbaric in the least
84431,Lupe Fiasco,A society at peace With liberty and justice for all
84432,Lupe Fiasco,Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
84433,Lupe Fiasco,They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
84434,Lupe Fiasco,That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
84435,Lupe Fiasco,From the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
84436,Lupe Fiasco,Everythings so organized They had to be well behaved
84437,Lupe Fiasco,Assumed they had clean energy little to no enemies
84438,Lupe Fiasco,Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
84439,Lupe Fiasco,Religions kinda complex Kinda hard to figure out
84440,Lupe Fiasco,But this must be the temple
84441,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84442,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84443,Lupe Fiasco,In the same suit that he was buried in
84444,Lupe Fiasco,Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
84445,Lupe Fiasco,Yes he was still fresh to death
84446,Lupe Fiasco,Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
84447,Lupe Fiasco,He still had it cause they couldnt find it
84448,Lupe Fiasco,And the bullets from his enemies
84449,Lupe Fiasco,Sat like two inches behind it
84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
84457,Lupe Fiasco,Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
84458,Lupe Fiasco,He saw that the latch was broken
84459,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84460,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84461,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84462,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84463,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84482,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84483,Lupe Fiasco,Caught the reflection in the window
84484,Lupe Fiasco,Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
84485,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah and gettin back in his lane
84486,Lupe Fiasco,First he had to find something to slang
84487,Lupe Fiasco,Walked right past the same spot
84488,Lupe Fiasco,That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
84489,Lupe Fiasco,It just felt weird being on the opposite
84490,Lupe Fiasco,They figured that he wasnt from there
84491,Lupe Fiasco,So they pulled out and robbed him
84492,Lupe Fiasco,With the same gun they shot him with
84493,Lupe Fiasco,Put it to his head and said
84494,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84495,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84496,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84497,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84498,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84499,Lupe Fiasco,Imma just go   And then well figure it out from there
84500,Lupe Fiasco,They say form follows function
84501,Lupe Fiasco,And if you just function properly things will form themselves
84502,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah thats kind of what it is
84503,Lupe Fiasco,So on that note   Americas most
84504,Lupe Fiasco,First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
84505,Lupe Fiasco,Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin around my temple
84506,Lupe Fiasco,Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
84507,Lupe Fiasco,Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
84508,Lupe Fiasco,Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
84509,Lupe Fiasco,And they sink in the same sea that we walk
84510,Lupe Fiasco,Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
84511,Lupe Fiasco,But you can hold my hand like applause pause
84512,Lupe Fiasco,With no homophobia involved
84513,Lupe Fiasco,Now if I wouldve said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
84514,Lupe Fiasco,That wouldve been the call but naw
84515,Lupe Fiasco,You cant see in ours but we can see in yours

84529,Lupe Fiasco,But thats only if you super dawg
84530,Lupe Fiasco,Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
84531,Lupe Fiasco,You can never really tell just whos the fraud
84532,Lupe Fiasco,Truth might still be alive like true and false
84533,Lupe Fiasco,Thats why I never really trust unless its Lu endorsed

98603,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98604,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98605,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98606,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98607,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion
98608,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in lyrics
98609,NF,Theyre all over the place theres songs in the mirrors
98610,NF,Written all over the floors all over the chairs
98611,NF,And you get the uncut version of life when I go downstairs
98612,NF,Thats where I write when Im in a bad place and need to release
98613,NF,And let out the version of NF you dont wanna see
98614,NF,I put holes in the walls with both of my fists til they bleed
98615,NF,You might get a glimpse of how I cope with all this anger in me
98616,NF,Physically abused now thats the room that I dont wanna be in
98617,NF,That picture aint blurry at all I just dont wanna see it
98618,NF,And these walls aint blank I just think I dont wanna see em
98619,NF,But why not Im in here so I might as well read em
98620,NF,I gotta thank you for this anger that I carry around
98621,NF,Wish I could take a match and burn this whole room to the ground
98622,NF,Matter of fact I think Ima burn this room right now
98623,NF,Somehow this memory for some reason just wont come down
98624,NF,You used to put me in the corner so you could see the fear in my eyes
98625,NF,Then took me downstairs and beat me til I screamed and I cried
98626,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98627,NF,But Ima keep the door shut and lock the lyrics inside
98628,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98629,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98630,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98631,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98632,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98633,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98634,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98635,NF,Yo my mind is a house with walls covered in pain
98636,NF,See my problem is I dont fix things I just try to repaint
98637,NF,Cover em up like it never happened say  I wish I could change 
98638,NF,Are you confused Come upstairs and Ill show you what I mean
98639,NF,This rooms full of regrets it just keeps getting fuller it seems
98640,NF,The moment I walk into its the same moment that I wanna leave
98641,NF,I get sick to my stomach every time I look at these things
98642,NF,But its hard to look past when this is the room where I sleep
98643,NF,I look around one of the worst things I wrote on these walls
98644,NF,Was the moment I realized that I was losing my mom
98645,NF,One of the first things I wrote was  I wish I woulda called 
98646,NF,But I should just stop now we aint got enough room in this song
98647,NF,And I regret the fact that I struggled trying to find who I am
98648,NF,And I lie to myself and say I do the best that I can
98649,NF,Shrug it off like it aint nothing like its out of my hands
98650,NF,Then get ticked off whenever I see it affecting my plans
98651,NF,And I regret watchin these trust issues eat me alive
98652,NF,And at the rate Im goin theyll probably still be there when I die
98653,NF,Congratulations youll always have a room in my mind
98654,NF,The question is will I ever clean the walls off in time 
98655,NF,Insidious is blind inception
98656,NF,Whats reality with all these questions 
98657,NF,Feels like I missed my alarm and slept in
98658,NF,Broken legs but I chase perfection
98659,NF,These walls are my blank expression
98660,NF,My mind is a home Im trapped in
98661,NF,And its lonely inside this mansion inside this mansion
98662,NF,So this part of my house no ones been in it for years
98663,NF,I built a safe room and I dont let no one in there
98664,NF,Cause if I do theres a chance that they might disappear
98665,NF,And not come back and I admit I am emotionally scared
98666,NF,To let anyone inside so I just leave my doors locked
98667,NF,You might get other doors to open up but this doors not
98668,NF,Cause I dont want you to have the opportunity to hurt me

98671,NF,Im not coming to the door so stop knockin stop knockin
98672,NF,Im trapped here God keeps saying Im not locked in
98673,NF,I chose this I am lost in my own conscience
98674,NF,I know that shuttin the world out aint solvin the problem
98675,NF,But I didnt build this house because I thought it would solve em
98676,NF,I built it because I thought that it was safer in there
98677,NF,But its not Im not the only thing thats livin in here
98678,NF,Fear came to my house years ago I let him in
98679,NF,Maybe thats the problem cause Ive been dealing with this ever since
98680,NF,I thought that he would leave but its obvious he never did
98681,NF,He must have picked the room and got comfortable and settled in
98682,NF,Now Im in a position its either sit here and let em win
98683,NF,Or put him back outside where he came from but I never can
98684,NF,Cause in order to do that Id have to open the doors
98685,NF,Is that me or the fear talking I dont know anymore

99742,NF,Put the controllers away its game over
99743,NF,The fans keep saying that theyre hungry for new music
99744,NF,Well thats pretty convenient cause I just made a plate for em

99754,NF,Yeah look  How Could You Leave Us is massive
99755,NF,There aint nothing I can write thatll match that
99756,NF,My biggest fear writing this record wasnt putting out trash
99757,NF,It was disappointing myself and the fanbase
99758,NF,Now I want you to picture me 
99759,NF,Im in a hotel rapping crying on the floor of the bathroom
99760,NF,Staring in the mirror my room hands shaking playing  How Could You Leave Us through the speakers on my iPhone
99761,NF,Tryna figure out if Ima always feel the way that I feel or maybe someday I can learn to be happy
99762,NF,Or maybe I cant be cause if the music aint emotional enough are they gon call me a has been

99764,NF,If I cut it off how am I supposed to keep growing
99765,NF,If I let it go wont my whole career be in ruins 
99766,NF,Thats when I realized this whole conversation is stupid
99767,NF,I never cared to impress people that dont even know me
99768,NF,I just write what I feel somehow it started a movement
99769,NF,Trying to enjoy a career but I dont know how to do it
99770,NF,When I spend all of my time being afraid Ima lose it 
99771,NF,But then I figured out the reason they follow me
99772,NF,The reason why these fans surrounding me
99773,NF,Its not cause Im a  Rap God 
99774,NF,I dont need you people to bow to me
99775,NF,All they ever did was doubt on me now everyones proud of me
99776,NF,Acknowledge me or not you aint ignoring the following
99777,NF,Im just teaching em something they couldnt learn in they colleges
99778,NF,This is for the kids feeling like they live at the bottom and every day of they lives feels like its darker than Halloween 
99779,NF,Yeah you aint alone out there look around you we got a lot of fans in here
99780,NF,Couple hundred thousand thats what we did last year
99781,NF,Listen to Intro III trying to kill my fear
99782,NF,Theyll get that in a minute
99783,NF,We about to shatter the critics
99784,NF,A lot of baggage I live in
99785,NF,Thats why the passion is different
99786,NF,Really dont care if they get it
99787,NF,Were only three records in it and this is just the beginning
99788,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99789,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99790,NF,If youd open your eyes then maybe youd see whats at stake
99791,NF,Youre sleeping youre sleeping
99792,NF,You make a lot of money and you live in a mansion
99793,NF,And pretty much got everything that you could ever imagine
99794,NF,But you feel like even though you got everything in the world
99795,NF,So what you do then is you start going backwards
99796,NF,And you lookin for something that isnt real
99797,NF,And all you know is that you just gotta have it
99798,NF,What youre doin is sleepin
99799,NF,And thinking that youre awake and youre not
99800,NF,And the problem is that you dont know what youre after
99801,NF,So you put everything that you have into what you do
99802,NF,Hoping that one day maybe you dont have to feel like youre empty
99803,NF,But as you get older a lot of weight on your shoulders is getting heavy
99804,NF,Then you look back and you start to regret things
99805,NF,And every time you lookin at yours
99806,NF,You feel like everything you have is a waste 
99807,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never fill a hole in your life
99808,NF,Is because you were never awake
99809,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99810,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99811,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99812,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99813,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99814,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99815,NF,You wake up in the morning
99816,NF,But you feel like you never got up and go to work
99817,NF,And you feelin like you aint got a purpose
99818,NF,And you tryna get motivated but everything you do turns into a mess
99819,NF,Like you aint nothing but worthless
99820,NF,A lot of these other people you lookin at
99821,NF,To you you describe as perfect
99822,NF,So you point a finger at God and tell him to do his job
99823,NF,And fix ya life up cause nothin is workin 
99824,NF,And you will try to hide it and make it seem like its nothin
99825,NF,But really you feel like everything is crashin around you
99826,NF,And you developed a problem in trusting in other people
99827,NF,Which later became an issue that would mentally pound you 
99828,NF,But every time you lookin at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes
99829,NF,And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life
99830,NF,Is because you were never awake 
99831,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99832,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99833,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99834,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99835,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99836,NF,Wake up wake up wake up wake up 
99837,NF,You spend your life in a dream that you cant escape
99838,NF,Cause you live your life in a coma youre never awake
99839,NF,Only time you ever call me is when you feelin like dont nobody else wanna listen
99840,NF,When s the last time you saw me
99841,NF,You probably don t remember that  cause that was back then you were different
99842,NF,I don t wanna hear the sorry s

99844,NF,Yeah you pass me in the hallway
99845,NF,But you ain t say a word to me
99846,NF,Lately all I ever feel is distant
99847,NF,You don t care that you lost me

99867,NF,They say that you are who you hang with
99868,NF,Maybe that s the reason you been changin
