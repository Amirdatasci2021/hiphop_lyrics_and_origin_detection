110178,Scarface,And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
110179,Scarface,The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
110180,Scarface,But once you in it its hard to get out of
110181,Scarface,And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do

110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness

111776,Scarface,The turn of the table the tale of the tape
111777,Scarface,The destruction of human flesh of the not so great
111778,Scarface,The long list of the John Doe s that accompany the spirit
111779,Scarface,As the yells of the souls lost with hopes that god hears it

111929,Scarface,Muthafucka you aint see my trunk
111930,Scarface,And a    gauge thatll fuck a nigga whole day
111931,Scarface,So recognize a real nigga from the streets
111932,Scarface,When you rolling through yo mutherfuckin hood what do you see 
111933,Scarface,Hollerin at my homie at the swisher house
111934,Scarface,Scored a   bag and we hit the spot

111941,Scarface,But other niggas dont wanna see it that way
111942,Scarface,But all I got to say is you dont wanna see that S A
111943,Scarface,Because were all upon a mission
111944,Scarface,Killin dont make us no different
111945,Scarface,And dyin dont make it no different
111946,Scarface,Cause I done been to mo wakes in this past year

111948,Scarface,So aint no muthafuckin thang for me
111949,Scarface,To kill a nigga who aint fuckin with the gang with me
111950,Scarface,Formaldehyde smokin niggas gettin loced and
111951,Scarface,Ready to pull your coat and leave your stomach open
111952,Scarface,Scoping hoping for you to fuck up and slip
111953,Scarface,So we can have a reason for fuckin up your shit
111954,Scarface, It aint no muthafuckin peace when they see me 
111955,Scarface,Cause we never had a muthafuckin peace treaty
111956,Scarface,So I know I got to get em with game
111957,Scarface,And when I hit em with the game I gotta hit em with this damn thang
111958,Scarface,Cause its kill or be killed never cut slack
111959,Scarface,And if you cut slack they bust back fuck that
111960,Scarface,I never give a second chance to pull the first gun
111961,Scarface,Cause if they bust one time that be the worst one
111962,Scarface,And thats the one that can close the shop
111963,Scarface,So you gotta stand and hold the Glock
111964,Scarface,Cause in my muthafuckin hood thats how it be
111965,Scarface,But when youre rollin through your muthafucking hood what do YOU see 
111966,Scarface,I always wanted to be the biggest man in somethin
111967,Scarface,But the world can leave a foul taste on the tongue
111968,Scarface,And the nigga that tried to pull it
111969,Scarface,If I dont get lean and blowed everyday
111970,Scarface,I feel just like Imma explode on overload and overdrive
111971,Scarface,All my life this drive I tried
111972,Scarface,I seen a lot of good niggas die
111973,Scarface,Cause somebody hated somebody lied or somebody snitched
111974,Scarface,I wish I could change the past
111975,Scarface,But I gots to live in the present and pray
111976,Scarface,That tomorrow this shit dont last Im livin to fast
111977,Scarface,Shit my momma asked me who I was like she aint know me
111978,Scarface,But to tell the truth I didnt know myself
111979,Scarface,I found out she had to told me
111980,Scarface,Just to show me just how good I had it
111981,Scarface,Mild mannered I just couldnt be it
111982,Scarface,But that was just the way we used to G it
111983,Scarface,One of the wrongest niggas I see
111984,Scarface,Or one of the strongest niggas I know
111985,Scarface,Walkin on my tippy toe cause the life I live aint long and I know
111986,Scarface,So I put weed in the bong and I blow
111987,Scarface,Stay cool calm and collected a neglected
111988,Scarface,Child that grew into a man thats widely respected
111989,Scarface,But that dont stop our pain
111990,Scarface,Or bring back our homeboys that we done lost off in this dirty game
111991,Scarface,I guess when your career is sellin dope somebody got to pay the price
111992,Scarface,These bitch ass niggas shife
111993,Scarface,Niggas might snitch out they momma
111994,Scarface,Thats why me and Leroy watch stay strapped and ready for all drama
111995,Scarface,Cause we aint promised tommorow
111996,Scarface,But nigga you promised to die
111997,Scarface,Nigga cant you see you gettin to high trippin of that potent fry
111998,Scarface,At night I talk to God and try to understand
111999,Scarface,How people can worship false prophets and say prayers to a man
112000,Scarface,I guess they already gone aint nothin gone bring them back
112001,Scarface,So I just say thanks for what I got and blow on indo sacks
112002,Scarface,I still love my piece and chain wood grain and big head ones
112003,Scarface,But I had to realize in life everything aint always fun
112004,Scarface,I guess thats true for some
112005,Scarface,But them hoes will never win
112006,Scarface,Out here just hustlin and grindin
