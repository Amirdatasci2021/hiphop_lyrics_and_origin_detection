39514,Eminem,It goes Reggie JayZ  Pac and Biggie
39515,Eminem,Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me

39534,Eminem,But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
39535,Eminem,If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
39536,Eminem, Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse

39538,Eminem,My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
39539,Eminem,I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
39540,Eminem,But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
39541,Eminem,The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
39542,Eminem,So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin at em
39543,Eminem,The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static 
39544,Eminem, Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters

39947,Eminem,And at the time every house that we lived in
39948,Eminem,Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
39949,Eminem,And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
39950,Eminem,Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
39951,Eminem,Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
39952,Eminem,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
39953,Eminem,And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart

39955,Eminem,On to Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
39956,Eminem,And Dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
39957,Eminem,And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
39958,Eminem,And met Dr Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
39959,Eminem,But Daddy had to work you and Momma had to leave me
39960,Eminem,Then you started seein Daddy on the TV and Momma didnt like it
39961,Eminem,And you and Lainie were too young to understand it

39963,Eminem,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
39964,Eminem,Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

40004,Eminem,Im starting to feel distant again
40005,Eminem,So I decided just to pick this pen
40006,Eminem,Up and try to make an attempt to vent
40007,Eminem,But I just cant admit or come to grips with the fact
40008,Eminem,That I may be done with rap I need a new outlet
40009,Eminem,And I know some shits so hard to swallow
40010,Eminem,But I just cant sit back and wallow

40118,Eminem,Thinkin he can try and solve em
40119,Eminem,Im outside chalkin up drawings
40120,Eminem,On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin

40135,Eminem,I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
40136,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
40137,Eminem, Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind bogglin
40138,Eminem, Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit

40151,Eminem,What about them rhymes Ive been jottin 
40152,Eminem,They are kind of giving me confidence
40153,Eminem,Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
40154,Eminem,Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx 
40155,Eminem,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that

40233,Eminem,But I think Im still tryin to figure this crap out
40234,Eminem,Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didnt
40235,Eminem,This fuckin black cloud still follows me around
40236,Eminem,But its time to exorcise these demons

40251,Eminem,It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
40252,Eminem,Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
40253,Eminem,So I could come back a brand new me
40254,Eminem,And dont even realize what you did believe me you
40255,Eminem,Ive been through the wringer
40256,Eminem,But they can do little to the middle finger
40257,Eminem,I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
40258,Eminem,My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
40259,Eminem,And drop dead no more beef lingers
40260,Eminem,No more drama from now on I promise
40261,Eminem,To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
40262,Eminem,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
40265,Eminem,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
40266,Eminem,Id shoot for the moon but Im too busy gazin at stars
40267,Eminem,I m not afraid  I m not afraid

40273,Eminem,Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road
40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40376,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40377,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40378,Eminem,Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for

40680,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40681,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
40709,Eminem,This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
40710,Eminem,Im still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute  cause 
40711,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
40733,Eminem,But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
40734,Eminem,That we just inherited   s beef with Murder Inc

40736,Eminem,We still have soldiers thats on the front line
40737,Eminem,Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
40738,Eminem,Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
40748,Eminem,Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
40749,Eminem,Off at your jaws well then I can  cause frankly Im sick of talkin

41198,Eminem,Is more than twice than a black life span
41199,Eminem,I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
41200,Eminem,I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
41201,Eminem,Id rather hear em say  Die N word than Die Antwoord
41202,Eminem,Ninja now its better disguised banter
41203,Eminem,But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
41204,Eminem,Were applying but McDonalds
41205,Eminem,Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
41206,Eminem,So how can we have higher standards 
41207,Eminem,As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
41208,Eminem,We fight back with violence but acts like that are
41209,Eminem,Black eyes on the movement
41210,Eminem,Which makes black lives madder
41211,Eminem,Thats why its at a stalemate
41212,Eminem,And cant arrive at a compromise so its Black Ops
41213,Eminem,I wonder if we hire more black cops the crap stops
41214,Eminem,The block is our backyards officers not the crack spot
41215,Eminem,Call the attack dogs off of us man
41216,Eminem,You always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop

41220,Eminem,Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers waving guns
41221,Eminem,And know nobody black so they act afraid of us
41222,Eminem,And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
41223,Eminem,Wait why are there black neighborhoods 
41224,Eminem,Cause America segregated us designated us to an area
41225,Eminem,Separated us Section Eightd us
41226,Eminem,When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
41227,Eminem,And education sucks and every days another
41228,Eminem,Freddie Gray for us a levy breaks or fuzz
41229,Eminem,Why is it they treat us like dryer lint 
41230,Eminem,We just want a safe environment for our kids
41231,Eminem,But can t escape the sirens
41232,Eminem,Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
41233,Eminem,The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
41234,Eminem,The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence
41235,Eminem,And we re trapped in these racial biases
41236,Eminem,That plague our society which makes our anxiety levels raise
41237,Eminem,Every time we see a devil s face
41238,Eminem,Lions tigers and bears oh my
41239,Eminem,Its more like billy clubs and gats
41240,Eminem,And we really love it when you think we re guilty  cause we re black
41241,Eminem, But you kill each other facts
41242,Eminem,You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats 
41243,Eminem,Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
41244,Eminem,While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
41245,Eminem,Fuck your Republican views
41246,Eminem,Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots 
41247,Eminem,And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
41248,Eminem,Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
41249,Eminem,You better be strapped with a derringer
41250,Eminem,Or be  capped in America like Steve Rogers
41251,Eminem,Cause no one oversees these cops and
41252,Eminem,All we see is em beat charges
41253,Eminem,We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
41254,Eminem,So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
41255,Eminem,Just keep marchin til we reach congress
41256,Eminem,But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
41257,Eminem,If you try to slander the flag but
41258,Eminem,Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
41259,Eminem,So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
41260,Eminem,If you dont stand for the national anthem
41261,Eminem,We raise it you better praise it
41262,Eminem,Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
41263,Eminem,Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
41264,Eminem,Home of the brave is still racist ville
41265,Eminem,So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
41266,Eminem,In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
41267,Eminem,That had its Natives killed
41268,Eminem,Got you singin this star spangled spiel

54940,J Cole,Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
54941,J Cole,Justin Timberlake Eminem and then Macklemore
54942,J Cole,While silly niggas argue over who gon snatch the crown
54943,J Cole,Look around my nigga white people have snatched the sound
54944,J Cole,This year I ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
54945,J Cole,Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
54946,J Cole,Im just playin but all good jokes contain true shit
54947,J Cole,Same rope you climb up on theyll hang you with
54948,J Cole,But not Jermaine my aim too sick
54949,J Cole,I bang nigga I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
54950,J Cole,You see how I maneuver this game I aint stupid
54951,J Cole,I recognize that life is a dream and I dream lucid
54952,J Cole,And break the chains and change minds
54953,J Cole,One verse at a time and claim    
54954,J Cole,And fuck it if the shoe fits whos the king 
54955,J Cole,Kings of ourselves first and foremost
54956,J Cole,While the people debate whos the king of this rap game
54957,J Cole,Here comes lil ol Jermaine
54958,J Cole,With every ounce of strength in his veins
54959,J Cole,To snatch the crown from whoever yall think has it
54960,J Cole,But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
54961,J Cole,Poof boom paow its like magic
54962,J Cole,With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
54963,J Cole,And falls to the Earth from which it came
54964,J Cole,Aint gonna be no more kings
54965,J Cole,Be wary of any man that claims
54966,J Cole,Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
54967,J Cole,Ultimately hes scared to die
54968,J Cole,But when Im in tune with the most high
54969,J Cole,I realize the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side
54970,J Cole,Today I know that we are the same are the same you and I
54971,J Cole,Different kind of skin different set of eyes
54972,J Cole,Two different minds but only one God
54973,J Cole,Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
54974,J Cole,Since a youngin always dreamed of gettin rich
54975,J Cole,Fantasize about a white picket fence
54976,J Cole,Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints

54978,J Cole,That the worlds a lot bigger ever since

55224,J Cole,Ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot
55225,J Cole,Im writing this because me and the devil had a dance
55226,J Cole,Now I see death around the corner pologizing in advance
55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
55301,J Cole,Thats the way I wished my family lived
55302,J Cole,But my granny crib was in the jects 
55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only
55313,J Cole,Dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
55322,J Cole,With lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old
55323,J Cole,Now its thirty years later making sure this storys told
55324,J Cole,Girl your daddy was a real nigga not cause he was cold
55325,J Cole,Not because he was the first

56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me

57936,J Cole,Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way

116426,Talib Kweli,Pitiful rappers never stand up to the ridicule
116427,Talib Kweli,Thats why I had to get at you
116428,Talib Kweli,Wear it if it fit the shoe nigga
116429,Talib Kweli, Baby just shine your light
116430,Talib Kweli,If youve gotta dim yours so they can shine brighter
116431,Talib Kweli,Just stay bright so shine your light 
116432,Talib Kweli,Were in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux The print the visual artist the musicians   which on the one hand intimidating and on the other immensely liberating The rules the assumptions the now were supposed tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then theyre breaking down The gatekeepers are leaving their gates You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen The old rules are crumbling And nobody knows what the new rules are so make up your own rules
116433,Talib Kweli,Peace peace everything we do is a creation
116434,Talib Kweli,In complete harmony our creation becomes art
116435,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented stems from the human imagination
116436,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented or created
116437,Talib Kweli,That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
116438,Talib Kweli,Science and the empirical man philosophy and the thinker
116439,Talib Kweli,Religion and the shaman art and the sick who can metabolize
116440,Talib Kweli,Everything with a trace of decay is human error
116441,Talib Kweli,Forgivable human error the curse
116442,Talib Kweli,From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
116443,Talib Kweli,Necessary evil so to speak or wed have figured it out by now
116444,Talib Kweli,Striving for perfection is a result of genius
116445,Talib Kweli,Find peace share your genius
116446,Talib Kweli,See I cant see my own face without a reflection
116447,Talib Kweli,Whether it be your reaction to my expression a mirror or water
116448,Talib Kweli,I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
116449,Talib Kweli,Through this understanding I know that all things are one
116450,Talib Kweli,According to science everything is a wave of energy
116451,Talib Kweli,A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
116452,Talib Kweli,My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
116453,Talib Kweli,Which my mind then depicts as images same goes for smell and touch
116454,Talib Kweli,Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
116455,Talib Kweli,Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
116456,Talib Kweli,Time and space disappear Im simply doing
116457,Talib Kweli,Yesterday tomorrow here there poof 
116458,Talib Kweli,It is always now all is energy
116459,Talib Kweli,Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
116460,Talib Kweli,Technically Im only a vessel channeling those thoughts
116461,Talib Kweli,My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
116462,Talib Kweli,Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
116463,Talib Kweli,I believe we all function with the same foundation
116464,Talib Kweli,Energy which is everything
116465,Talib Kweli,Everything is one big ocean of energy
116466,Talib Kweli,Everything is within you everything is you
116467,Talib Kweli,The identity of me is but a series of memories
116468,Talib Kweli,In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
116469,Talib Kweli,The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
116470,Talib Kweli,In other words energy can neither be created or destroyed
116471,Talib Kweli,We are thus forever and death is but a blink
116472,Talib Kweli,So I ask why hurt Why kill Why hate Why fear Why war 
116473,Talib Kweli,Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself 
116474,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116475,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116476,Talib Kweli,If energy only seems to transform then why not 
116477,Talib Kweli,It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
116478,Talib Kweli,We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
116479,Talib Kweli,A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
116480,Talib Kweli,In the same fashion as electrons do
116481,Talib Kweli,Around the nucleus which form the cells which form us
116482,Talib Kweli,Ah yes all is one and my friends it is beautiful
116483,Talib Kweli,Let us unify our heart now feel your power and I thank you
116484,Talib Kweli,Snap ya fingers do ya step
116485,Talib Kweli,The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
116486,Talib Kweli,Delivered hand to hand like we slangin the mixtapes
116487,Talib Kweli,You tryin to describe us you might as well get it straight
116488,Talib Kweli,We the content creators we greater than clickbait
116489,Talib Kweli,The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
116490,Talib Kweli,Its a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
116491,Talib Kweli,We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
116492,Talib Kweli,While I get my energy from the sun all things are one
116493,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116494,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongue
116495,Talib Kweli,My color is my penalty mentally on the run
116496,Talib Kweli,Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun huh
116497,Talib Kweli,Releasing blockages I aint stoppin until they gone
116498,Talib Kweli,Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
116499,Talib Kweli,Until I realized I can change whats going on  lets go  
116500,Talib Kweli,To every single place I go Im right at home
116501,Talib Kweli,Im right at home  lets go  
116502,Talib Kweli,Waiting for that day to come huh
116503,Talib Kweli,Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
116504,Talib Kweli,Get my energy from the sun
116505,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116506,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongues
116507,Talib Kweli,Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
116508,Talib Kweli,Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
116509,Talib Kweli,Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
116510,Talib Kweli,If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth 
116511,Talib Kweli,Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
116512,Talib Kweli,If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
116513,Talib Kweli,Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
116514,Talib Kweli,If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
116515,Talib Kweli,Naturally thats confusion to a youngn trying to follow Christ
116516,Talib Kweli,Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
116517,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
116518,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
116519,Talib Kweli,And who was King James And why did he think that it was so vital
116520,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
116521,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground Heaven is in the sky
116522,Talib Kweli,They say thats where you go when you die but how they know 
116523,Talib Kweli,Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
116524,Talib Kweli,Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
116525,Talib Kweli,I used to study my lessons that was a blessing not a curse
116526,Talib Kweli,I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth word
116527,Talib Kweli,Studied with Rastafarians found out from the dreads that hell
116528,Talib Kweli,Is called Babylon and thats where the crazy boarheads dwell
116529,Talib Kweli,They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
116530,Talib Kweli,But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
116531,Talib Kweli,So it all sound the same to me
116532,Talib Kweli,But when they say ones right and the other is wrong
116533,Talib Kweli,It just sound like game to me
116534,Talib Kweli,Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
116535,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
116536,Talib Kweli,The difference between those that claim to be
116537,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual
116538,Talib Kweli,And recognize that life is full of miracles
116539,Talib Kweli,You can see the flow is divine
116540,Talib Kweli,Cause it coincide with a growing tide
116541,Talib Kweli,Of those looking for God that know to go inside
116542,Talib Kweli,The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
116543,Talib Kweli,Based on his interpretation
116544,Talib Kweli,Of what the words are saying
116545,Talib Kweli,Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
116546,Talib Kweli,Make the Muslim hate the Christian
116547,Talib Kweli,Make the Christian hate the Jew
116548,Talib Kweli,That you condition to and gotta follow
116549,Talib Kweli,But if you ever been to any ghetto then you know it well
116550,Talib Kweli,Lighten it up brighten it up yea
116551,Talib Kweli,You want the grown step your bars up
116552,Talib Kweli,You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
116553,Talib Kweli,Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli
116554,Talib Kweli,Such a blessing Im making the bread leven
116555,Talib Kweli,Descendant of Terra Firma Im from the era of legend
116556,Talib Kweli,The blind to my eyesight too scared of the world ending
116557,Talib Kweli,My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
116558,Talib Kweli,Ascending without the stairs expressing without the fears
116559,Talib Kweli,We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
116560,Talib Kweli,Unravelling minds travelling through time like langoliers
116561,Talib Kweli,Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
116562,Talib Kweli,In the park of Washington Square locks in my hair
116563,Talib Kweli,Louder than the bull horns we was locking em there
116564,Talib Kweli,Cops would prepare to lock us up
116565,Talib Kweli,They was scared like tales from the dark side
116566,Talib Kweli,Summer of the Central Park five

116568,Talib Kweli,From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin
116569,Talib Kweli,Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
116570,Talib Kweli,Therapy for the prison industrial complex
116571,Talib Kweli,Provided the context for the crime with the TEC  
116572,Talib Kweli,At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
116573,Talib Kweli,I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
116574,Talib Kweli,Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
116575,Talib Kweli,An internal with Puff Daddy in front of the buffed patio
116576,Talib Kweli,Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the Nati

116579,Talib Kweli,We was standing outside the tower devouring prey
116580,Talib Kweli,Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
116581,Talib Kweli,Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
116582,Talib Kweli,I played it like I was David I was tackling that Goliath
116583,Talib Kweli,Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
116584,Talib Kweli,This life it was so enticing my surgery so precise
116585,Talib Kweli,I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
116586,Talib Kweli,At the country club lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
116587,Talib Kweli,At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
116588,Talib Kweli,Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
