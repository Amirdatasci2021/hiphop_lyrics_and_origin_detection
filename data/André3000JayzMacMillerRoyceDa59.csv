104968,Royce Da 59,Uh on our way to that black amusement park
104969,Royce Da 59,Wood rollercoasters crack sold on plastic scooter cars
104970,Royce Da 59,Uh smoking grass at the vintage food court

104977,Royce Da 59,First time big bro hit the bottle was on the Bob Lo boat
104978,Royce Da 59,But neither one of us knew that we would both

105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
