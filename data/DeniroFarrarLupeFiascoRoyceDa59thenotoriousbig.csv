29564,Deniro Farrar,  Consistently Inconsistent
82090,Lupe Fiasco,Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
82091,Lupe Fiasco,Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
82092,Lupe Fiasco,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself
82105,Lupe Fiasco,As most important source of help
82106,Lupe Fiasco,And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
82107,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82108,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
82109,Lupe Fiasco,On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
82110,Lupe Fiasco,It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
82111,Lupe Fiasco,They understand the Internet better than their parents
82112,Lupe Fiasco,Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
82113,Lupe Fiasco,Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
82114,Lupe Fiasco,A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
82115,Lupe Fiasco,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
82116,Lupe Fiasco, Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
82117,Lupe Fiasco,Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches  
82118,Lupe Fiasco,Now lets say that they less concerned with him
82119,Lupe Fiasco,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
82120,Lupe Fiasco,Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
82121,Lupe Fiasco,Reality check Im not trippin
82122,Lupe Fiasco,They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
82123,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82124,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82125,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82126,Lupe Fiasco,Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using  bitch as a lesson
82127,Lupe Fiasco,But as a psychological weapon
82128,Lupe Fiasco,To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
82129,Lupe Fiasco,Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
82130,Lupe Fiasco, Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
82131,Lupe Fiasco,Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
82132,Lupe Fiasco,Sho enough in this little world
82133,Lupe Fiasco,The little boy meets one of those little girls
82134,Lupe Fiasco,And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
82135,Lupe Fiasco,He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
82136,Lupe Fiasco,She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
82137,Lupe Fiasco,He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
82138,Lupe Fiasco,Momma never dressed like that
82139,Lupe Fiasco,Come out the house hot mess like that
82140,Lupe Fiasco,Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
82141,Lupe Fiasco,Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
82142,Lupe Fiasco,He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
82143,Lupe Fiasco, Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
82144,Lupe Fiasco,But  bad mean bad to him  bitch dont play a part
82145,Lupe Fiasco,But  bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
82146,Lupe Fiasco,But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre 
82147,Lupe Fiasco,Tell em bitch bad woman good
82148,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82149,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82150,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82151,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82152,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better greatest motherhood
82153,Lupe Fiasco,Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
82154,Lupe Fiasco,Vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
82155,Lupe Fiasco,To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
82156,Lupe Fiasco,Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
82157,Lupe Fiasco,Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm 
82158,Lupe Fiasco,But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
82159,Lupe Fiasco,So what powers cowards to get them to the top
82160,Lupe Fiasco,Just to fall asleep listening to Bach 
82161,Lupe Fiasco,The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
82162,Lupe Fiasco,Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
82163,Lupe Fiasco,That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
82164,Lupe Fiasco,They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
82165,Lupe Fiasco,Now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling 
82166,Lupe Fiasco,And whats the talking without the match feeling
82167,Lupe Fiasco,Thats buried living And cherry picking
82168,Lupe Fiasco,Every lemon from your berry system
82169,Lupe Fiasco,Then proceed with the pack feeding
82170,Lupe Fiasco,When I was young I had visions of another world
82171,Lupe Fiasco,Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
82172,Lupe Fiasco,Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
82173,Lupe Fiasco,Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
82174,Lupe Fiasco,I like my pancakes cut in swirls
82175,Lupe Fiasco,Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
82176,Lupe Fiasco,I like cartoons southern cities with large moons
82177,Lupe Fiasco,Faith healers ex female drug dealers and art booms
82178,Lupe Fiasco,Apologize for my weird mix
82179,Lupe Fiasco,What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
82180,Lupe Fiasco,And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
82181,Lupe Fiasco,And smells like shotguns and deer piss
82182,Lupe Fiasco,They on their hunt kind of salty that Im going hard
82183,Lupe Fiasco,First part of a party that I throw in parts
82184,Lupe Fiasco,One minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
82185,Lupe Fiasco,But thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
82186,Lupe Fiasco,I run the Gambit like Im throwing cards
82187,Lupe Fiasco,From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
82188,Lupe Fiasco,Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
82189,Lupe Fiasco,Nerd gang make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
82190,Lupe Fiasco,A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
82191,Lupe Fiasco,Backup the wordplay playing at the mans states
82192,Lupe Fiasco,Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
82193,Lupe Fiasco,And when demand brakes Im reflectious what they cant face
82194,Lupe Fiasco,My peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
82195,Lupe Fiasco,The unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
82196,Lupe Fiasco,That hovers above cities like weather men
82197,Lupe Fiasco,Whatever better to tell ya weather comin
82198,Lupe Fiasco,I prefer girls to reign all over the world
82199,Lupe Fiasco,And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
82200,Lupe Fiasco,Or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
82201,Lupe Fiasco,Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
82202,Lupe Fiasco,But reign like Queens that reign over made man
82203,Lupe Fiasco,And not Queen like Queen killer rhapsody bohemian Queen
82204,Lupe Fiasco,But Queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave
82205,Lupe Fiasco,So you make a fan by waving your hand Im talking wave like you saying  Hey man  
82206,Lupe Fiasco,And not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
82207,Lupe Fiasco,You gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
82208,Lupe Fiasco,And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
82209,Lupe Fiasco,And especially when youre recording
82210,Lupe Fiasco,Cause thats the portion thats important
82211,Lupe Fiasco,When I was reporting that I was poor but now Im more than  poor 
82212,Lupe Fiasco,Its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
82213,Lupe Fiasco,Crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops
82214,Lupe Fiasco,Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots
82215,Lupe Fiasco,A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
82216,Lupe Fiasco,And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
82217,Lupe Fiasco,And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
82218,Lupe Fiasco,So the sun rise when the beat drops and the sun dies when the beat stops   
82219,Lupe Fiasco,Then it unties then it relocks then it relapsed then it detox
82220,Lupe Fiasco,Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
82221,Lupe Fiasco,Cause he want what we got like yeah
82222,Lupe Fiasco,Then forge poetry like a young ornery Morrissey
82223,Lupe Fiasco,Then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery
82224,Lupe Fiasco,Not scorching nor sorbet y
82225,Lupe Fiasco,From the steel orbitings sorcerer sorcery
82226,Lupe Fiasco,Coming down gorgeously just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
82227,Lupe Fiasco,A more torturing a water boarding Barbie doll
82228,Lupe Fiasco,A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival
82229,Lupe Fiasco,Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
82230,Lupe Fiasco,Somebody give them the volleyballs
82231,Lupe Fiasco,If you love her dont ever send her to Mally Malls
82232,Lupe Fiasco,Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macaulys claws
82233,Lupe Fiasco,Coming out the closet over goblets down at Madri Gras
82234,Lupe Fiasco,The fame champagne walk of shame lobby call
82235,Lupe Fiasco,My rap position was black condition and activism
82236,Lupe Fiasco,Ammunition for abolition missions attacking systems
82237,Lupe Fiasco,But theyre not apt to listen unless its dropping on Activision
82238,Lupe Fiasco,Are we apps or are we bodies filled with apparitions 
82239,Lupe Fiasco,Operating applications stuck inside an Apple prison
82240,Lupe Fiasco,Chicken hack and download updates that lack religion
82241,Lupe Fiasco,   Than soil tainting disloyal changelings
82242,Lupe Fiasco,Preoccupied with boy and Goyle chasing and foiling others royal saintings 
82243,Lupe Fiasco,I sit back and watch the world through eye holes in my oil paintings
82244,Lupe Fiasco,Uhhh Aint nothin to it but to do it
82245,Lupe Fiasco,Unless you Virgin Mary nothin do it but the truest
82246,Lupe Fiasco,Believe all that unless you Jewish
82247,Lupe Fiasco,Life is not a dictionary its a thesaurus
82248,Lupe Fiasco,And I feel like a missionary to a clitoris
82249,Lupe Fiasco,The water bearer heir of traditions that I swear to never change
82250,Lupe Fiasco,My chair position or conditions of my porridge
82251,Lupe Fiasco,Submission for sedition against the religion of a chorus
82252,Lupe Fiasco,Keep them golden weave thieves out the mothafuckin forest
82253,Lupe Fiasco,As I perform a nerve storm I prefer my pictures in word form
82254,Lupe Fiasco,Bury the hatchet like how a bird born
82255,Lupe Fiasco,As I paint cold pictures like Kool Aid facing condensation
82256,Lupe Fiasco,Having conversations with flavorful combinations
82257,Lupe Fiasco,Slave to my concentration so thats OJ da Juiceman meets OJ with two hands
82258,Lupe Fiasco,And two gloves thats too snug to judge who was who drew blood
82259,Lupe Fiasco,And Lupe look at all these toucans in a cemetery full of tomahawks
82260,Lupe Fiasco,Giving middle fingers to the pigeons doing somersaults
82261,Lupe Fiasco,Road runners dont fall off cliffs they run across
82262,Lupe Fiasco,Anomalies by the colony flukes by the reservoir
82263,Lupe Fiasco,Wildin pursuers end up as poofs on the desert floor
82264,Lupe Fiasco,Levitating youths who know the truth of where the fountain hides
82265,Lupe Fiasco,Buccaro roof painting tunnels onto the mountain sides
82266,Lupe Fiasco,A thousand parts a pound of heart an ounce of eyes
82267,Lupe Fiasco,Announcing now the doubt in mouth pronounces a count of lies
82268,Lupe Fiasco,Chocula Counts by the count of five
82269,Lupe Fiasco,Refrigerator roof full of animals and monsters
82270,Lupe Fiasco,Incinerator chutes and the manual for Contra
82271,Lupe Fiasco,Assorted memories from my childhood
82272,Lupe Fiasco,Absorbing energy from the wild woods
82273,Lupe Fiasco,Electronic combat Konami sign contract
82274,Lupe Fiasco,Chinese chalk killing cucarachas on contact
82275,Lupe Fiasco,Chicago spray gun aficionado
82276,Lupe Fiasco,Efficient spitting bridging divisions isnt Chicano
82277,Lupe Fiasco,Who s the Boss If it isnt Alyssa Milano
82278,Lupe Fiasco,Dudikoff ninja mission into the Congo
82279,Lupe Fiasco,Polarize envy of the older guys
82280,Lupe Fiasco,Black obi shinobi hittin Kenno in the face with all my throwin knives
82281,Lupe Fiasco,Sub zero guiding hiding riding in the pack as well
82282,Lupe Fiasco,Sound village Leaf village wolf spirit magic spells
82283,Lupe Fiasco,Dodging rain and catching hail
82284,Lupe Fiasco,Faces need samurais to catch the L
82285,Lupe Fiasco,Special research vessels made for catching whales
82286,Lupe Fiasco,Filet o fish ships sea shepherded peppered with extra sails
82287,Lupe Fiasco,Rewrite history liberty needs a better bell
82288,Lupe Fiasco,Maybe harder irons and carbon fibers that never fail
82289,Lupe Fiasco,Smarter science mixed with a odd alliance of fairy tale
82290,Lupe Fiasco,Or maybe just a metal pail you hit with steel tools
82291,Lupe Fiasco,To announce that youve had enough and dropping out of SEAL school
82292,Lupe Fiasco,Just like trout jumping out their house to let their gills cool
82293,Lupe Fiasco,Cuba scuba couldnt take the temperature of my skill pool
82294,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah I said it feels cool to kill fools
82295,Lupe Fiasco,Slipping through the cracks like when you try to grill gruel
82296,Lupe Fiasco,Techno Viking water bottle and not following pill rules
82297,Lupe Fiasco,Will have you off the throttle when you should be modelin chill mood
82298,Lupe Fiasco,Roller skater maker or are you just cobblin wheel shoes
82299,Lupe Fiasco,Overweight taster of kings food that kills crews

84396,Lupe Fiasco,A pageantry of feathers stands his majesty with treasure
84397,Lupe Fiasco,Not the material things of kings that could never last forever

84399,Lupe Fiasco,Unbeknownst to him his head would be the first that they would sever
84400,Lupe Fiasco,And stuck up on a pike up along the beach
84401,Lupe Fiasco,Kept up as a warning to the rest to turn away from their beliefs
84402,Lupe Fiasco,And so began it here And for five hundred years
84403,Lupe Fiasco,Torture terror fear til they nearly disappear
84404,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84405,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84406,Lupe Fiasco,Ways and means from the trade of human beings
84407,Lupe Fiasco,A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
84408,Lupe Fiasco,And helps the new regime establish and expand
84409,Lupe Fiasco,Using manifest destiny to siphon off the land
84410,Lupe Fiasco,From native caretakers who can barely understand
84411,Lupe Fiasco,How can land be owned by another man 
84412,Lupe Fiasco,Warns  One can not steal what was given as a gift 
84413,Lupe Fiasco,Is the sky owned by birds and the rivers owned by fish

84417,Lupe Fiasco,The forestss were cleared the factories were built
84418,Lupe Fiasco,And all mistakes will be repeated
84419,Lupe Fiasco,By your future generations doomed to pay for your mistreatments
84420,Lupe Fiasco,Foolishness and flaws greed and needs and disagreement
84421,Lupe Fiasco,And then you rush to have the most from the day you left your boats
84422,Lupe Fiasco,Youll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts
84423,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84424,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84425,Lupe Fiasco,As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
84426,Lupe Fiasco,A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
84427,Lupe Fiasco,They discover ancient cars on even older streets
84428,Lupe Fiasco,And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
84429,Lupe Fiasco,A culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth
84430,Lupe Fiasco,They can tell that they were civil not barbaric in the least
84431,Lupe Fiasco,A society at peace With liberty and justice for all
84432,Lupe Fiasco,Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
84433,Lupe Fiasco,They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
84434,Lupe Fiasco,That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
84435,Lupe Fiasco,From the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
84436,Lupe Fiasco,Everythings so organized They had to be well behaved
84437,Lupe Fiasco,Assumed they had clean energy little to no enemies
84438,Lupe Fiasco,Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
84439,Lupe Fiasco,Religions kinda complex Kinda hard to figure out
84440,Lupe Fiasco,But this must be the temple
84441,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84442,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84443,Lupe Fiasco,In the same suit that he was buried in
84444,Lupe Fiasco,Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
84445,Lupe Fiasco,Yes he was still fresh to death
84446,Lupe Fiasco,Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
84447,Lupe Fiasco,He still had it cause they couldnt find it
84448,Lupe Fiasco,And the bullets from his enemies
84449,Lupe Fiasco,Sat like two inches behind it
84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
84457,Lupe Fiasco,Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
84458,Lupe Fiasco,He saw that the latch was broken
84459,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84460,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84461,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84462,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84463,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84482,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84483,Lupe Fiasco,Caught the reflection in the window
84484,Lupe Fiasco,Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
84485,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah and gettin back in his lane
84486,Lupe Fiasco,First he had to find something to slang
84487,Lupe Fiasco,Walked right past the same spot
84488,Lupe Fiasco,That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
84489,Lupe Fiasco,It just felt weird being on the opposite
84490,Lupe Fiasco,They figured that he wasnt from there
84491,Lupe Fiasco,So they pulled out and robbed him
84492,Lupe Fiasco,With the same gun they shot him with
84493,Lupe Fiasco,Put it to his head and said
84494,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84495,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84496,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84497,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84498,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84499,Lupe Fiasco,Imma just go   And then well figure it out from there

84506,Lupe Fiasco,Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
84507,Lupe Fiasco,Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
84508,Lupe Fiasco,Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
84509,Lupe Fiasco,And they sink in the same sea that we walk
84510,Lupe Fiasco,Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
84511,Lupe Fiasco,But you can hold my hand like applause pause
84512,Lupe Fiasco,With no homophobia involved
84513,Lupe Fiasco,Now if I wouldve said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls

105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent

105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice
