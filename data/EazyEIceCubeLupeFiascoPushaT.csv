47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police

47872,Ice Cube,When you try to tell your side
47873,Ice Cube,Boy you better duck cuz the book is comin
47874,Ice Cube,And just hand your car keys over to your woman

47883,Ice Cube,On the streets I was damn near outta my mind
47884,Ice Cube,But ever since Ive been down
47885,Ice Cube,Now heres the game plan yo at a quarter to nine
47886,Ice Cube,I was told to peel a cap on the other side

47888,Ice Cube,I gotta put in work for the hood and that aint no joke
47889,Ice Cube,Stable and able but Im not ready and willin

47893,Ice Cube,Yo spotted the enemies now Im on a creep tip
47894,Ice Cube,Hit the  dollar stick and I put in my clip
47895,Ice Cube,So I jumped out the car and no matter what the cost
47896,Ice Cube,I had my mind set on sendin niggas to Harrison Ross
47897,Ice Cube,Caught one from the back and I looked in eyes
47898,Ice Cube,Thinkin should I peel his cap or should I let him survive
47899,Ice Cube,Yo Im trapped in the plan designed by another side
47900,Ice Cube,I aint contributin to genocide  why  
47901,Ice Cube,Niggas in the hood aint changed
47902,Ice Cube,And Ive finally figure out that were not in the same gang
47903,Ice Cube,Cuz I walk the alleys of Compton with nowhere to turn
47904,Ice Cube,Every which way I get burned 
47905,Ice Cube,Baby Lou wears blue Big Fred wears red
47906,Ice Cube,Put em together and we color em dead
47907,Ice Cube,Dead dyin gettin smokeds like part of the fun
47908,Ice Cube,They get smoked just to show how many come to the funeral
47909,Ice Cube,I understand how all my homeboys feel
47910,Ice Cube,Cuz I been shot to this day I pack my steel
47911,Ice Cube,Cuz I was born in a certain territory
47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep
47915,Ice Cube,Cuz me and T bone we pay it no mind
47916,Ice Cube,And for the rest of the mob we stay color blind

47920,Ice Cube,Well provide you with everything you need to survive in life Well help you to be the best soldier in the U S of A
47921,Ice Cube,Because we do more before  A M than most niggers do in their whole lifetime
47922,Ice Cube,I wanna kill him cause he tried to play me like the trick
47923,Ice Cube,But you see Im the wrong nigga to fuck with
47924,Ice Cube,I got the A to the motherfuckin K and its ready to rip
47925,Ice Cube,Is he in Watts Oakland Philly or Brooklyn 
47926,Ice Cube,It seems like he got the whole country behind him
47927,Ice Cube,So its sort of hard to find him
47928,Ice Cube,But when I do gotta put my gat in his mouth
47929,Ice Cube,Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
47930,Ice Cube,Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
47931,Ice Cube,Tried to fuck a brother up the ass like a small whore

48018,Ice Cube,FF Yo we out of here five thousand
48019,Ice Cube,Yo this is for my boy Ice Cube you know what Im saying
82090,Lupe Fiasco,Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
82091,Lupe Fiasco,Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
82092,Lupe Fiasco,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself
82105,Lupe Fiasco,As most important source of help
82106,Lupe Fiasco,And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
82107,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82108,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
82109,Lupe Fiasco,On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
82110,Lupe Fiasco,It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
82111,Lupe Fiasco,They understand the Internet better than their parents
82112,Lupe Fiasco,Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
82113,Lupe Fiasco,Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
82114,Lupe Fiasco,A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
82115,Lupe Fiasco,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
82116,Lupe Fiasco, Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
82117,Lupe Fiasco,Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches  
82118,Lupe Fiasco,Now lets say that they less concerned with him
82119,Lupe Fiasco,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
82120,Lupe Fiasco,Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
82121,Lupe Fiasco,Reality check Im not trippin
82122,Lupe Fiasco,They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
82123,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82124,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82125,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82126,Lupe Fiasco,Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using  bitch as a lesson
82127,Lupe Fiasco,But as a psychological weapon
82128,Lupe Fiasco,To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
82129,Lupe Fiasco,Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
82130,Lupe Fiasco, Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
82131,Lupe Fiasco,Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
82132,Lupe Fiasco,Sho enough in this little world
82133,Lupe Fiasco,The little boy meets one of those little girls
82134,Lupe Fiasco,And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
82135,Lupe Fiasco,He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
82136,Lupe Fiasco,She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
82137,Lupe Fiasco,He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
82138,Lupe Fiasco,Momma never dressed like that
82139,Lupe Fiasco,Come out the house hot mess like that
82140,Lupe Fiasco,Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
82141,Lupe Fiasco,Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
82142,Lupe Fiasco,He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
82143,Lupe Fiasco, Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
82144,Lupe Fiasco,But  bad mean bad to him  bitch dont play a part
82145,Lupe Fiasco,But  bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
82146,Lupe Fiasco,But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre 
82147,Lupe Fiasco,Tell em bitch bad woman good
82148,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82149,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say

84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture

84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
