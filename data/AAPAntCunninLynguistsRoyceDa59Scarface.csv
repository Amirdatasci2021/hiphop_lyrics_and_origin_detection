23544,CunninLynguists,Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
23545,CunninLynguists,Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
23546,CunninLynguists,So girls create a false world of filling on boys
23547,CunninLynguists,Exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
23548,CunninLynguists,But when you have it theres nothing like it you get excited

23559,CunninLynguists,Cause over all its an emotion I cannot comprehend
23560,CunninLynguists,Love aint the basis for action
23561,CunninLynguists,In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
23562,CunninLynguists,Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
23563,CunninLynguists,Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
23564,CunninLynguists,And the past isnt felt as a match made in hell
23565,CunninLynguists,But rather its held as a latter day meld
23566,CunninLynguists,Of common mistakes and nice intentions
23567,CunninLynguists,But when false love retention is simply vice invention
23568,CunninLynguists,Its only right to mention the fights you get in
23569,CunninLynguists,Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
23570,CunninLynguists,So whats love really got to do with it

23874,CunninLynguists,A pulsing tension carries my very frame
23875,CunninLynguists,I rise up in ascension  WAIT 
23876,CunninLynguists,I try to escape but I arrive at these gates

23887,CunninLynguists,As any other single father
23888,CunninLynguists,Who raised a baby girl graciously
23889,CunninLynguists,Nakedly she was at your door after her mothers death
23890,CunninLynguists,Ignorant to racial anger and other stress
23891,CunninLynguists,Later had a mixed baby at her sweet sixteen
23892,CunninLynguists,How did that fit within your picnic scene 
23893,CunninLynguists,Sometimes its too late to fix these things
23894,CunninLynguists,The pristine dream was over
23895,CunninLynguists,Had to face the fact she split these genes with his sick seed
23896,CunninLynguists,With skin the darkest pigment seen
23897,CunninLynguists,And so I kicked and screamed
23898,CunninLynguists,Until we found the peace that distance brings
23899,CunninLynguists,A mixed raced queen that was your thoughts about her mama
23900,CunninLynguists,Up yonder went her soul your hate growed from ponders

23932,CunninLynguists,Growth from the rain of the previous years
23933,CunninLynguists,I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears

23943,CunninLynguists,It was  Live Florida crews caught heat for rappin
23944,CunninLynguists,But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
23945,CunninLynguists,And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
23946,CunninLynguists,The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
23947,CunninLynguists,Strictly  My Niggas that were ready to die in the ride
23948,CunninLynguists,I wish the summers vibe couldve lasted forever

23980,CunninLynguists,Jolly fat white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
23981,CunninLynguists,And artists themselves get treated like Elves

23996,CunninLynguists,Mixed with the misfits fix is the hurt
23997,CunninLynguists,When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
23998,CunninLynguists,French kiss vixens distant and cursed
23999,CunninLynguists,Burned bridges occurred from scriptin my words
24000,CunninLynguists,Word so Ill chisel a verse
24001,CunninLynguists,On these lie filled halls that Ive lived in and searched
24002,CunninLynguists,Im still lost in a head of catacombs
24003,CunninLynguists,Cause I build walls like Im Edgar Allan Poe
24004,CunninLynguists,Ive killed off every damsel that I know
24005,CunninLynguists,For castles that I keep castles that I know
24006,CunninLynguists,Im having spirits in the dark laying under moonlight
24007,CunninLynguists,Laughing with a stranger like I saved her from her doomed life
24008,CunninLynguists,Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
24009,CunninLynguists,Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
24010,CunninLynguists,A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
24011,CunninLynguists,Life is like a lion and Im dying at its feet
24012,CunninLynguists,I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
24013,CunninLynguists,Ive seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B roll
24014,CunninLynguists,My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
24015,CunninLynguists,And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
24016,CunninLynguists,My memory banks the only thing I tend to rob
24017,CunninLynguists,And every time I phone the lob Im out of dodge
24018,CunninLynguists,Its hard on the boulevard and other clich s
24019,CunninLynguists,The type of bullshit that Im feeding self these days
24020,CunninLynguists,Corrosion on my relays one thing my mirrors chose
24021,CunninLynguists,An imp in new clothes exposed
24022,CunninLynguists,I mow a dead lawn aim for the alpha
24023,CunninLynguists,Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
24024,CunninLynguists,Not a man a receptacle for crest fallen matter
24025,CunninLynguists,Never tempered or pressed into patterns
24026,CunninLynguists,But just wont die instead a palpitation from the plasma
24027,CunninLynguists,Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at em
24028,CunninLynguists,I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
24029,CunninLynguists,Then off into my extremities and out into the public
24030,CunninLynguists,In a flood of shadow puppetry something in the air
24031,CunninLynguists,Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self aware
24032,CunninLynguists,Its recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
24033,CunninLynguists,Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
24034,CunninLynguists,Close encounters exacerbate his condition
24035,CunninLynguists,From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
24036,CunninLynguists,Tune into the Casio adventures
24037,CunninLynguists,When the rest of me can barely form a god damn sentence
24038,CunninLynguists,You can only see the stars when it s Don Cheadle black

24064,CunninLynguists,Could go from street singers to pop figures
24065,CunninLynguists,From block niggas to a brotha that is followin stock tickers
24066,CunninLynguists,To grow in the night you gotta create light
24067,CunninLynguists,Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight
24068,CunninLynguists,No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam
24069,CunninLynguists,And you don t need a telescope to detect dream
24070,CunninLynguists,You blessed with a mind that can see through space
24071,CunninLynguists,On dark nights in the stars you can find your face
24072,CunninLynguists,Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
24073,CunninLynguists,Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

24082,CunninLynguists,In monsoon proportions them moments of importance
24083,CunninLynguists,When victory s in vain it s the same the blood coursing
24084,CunninLynguists,Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
24085,CunninLynguists,Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment
24086,CunninLynguists,Poised when them black clouds come  round don t back down
24087,CunninLynguists,Let haters be theme music playin in the background
24088,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24089,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24090,CunninLynguists,There was a time when I couldnt find energy
24091,CunninLynguists,The only person that was feelin me was Mrs Hennessy
24092,CunninLynguists,Its like life was pinnin me down
24093,CunninLynguists,I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
24094,CunninLynguists,You aint gonna be a rapper youre not a factor
24095,CunninLynguists,You just a Kentucky boy get yourself a tractor
24096,CunninLynguists,Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
24097,CunninLynguists,Thats when the liquor and weed became a need
24098,CunninLynguists,Self esteem was lower than snorkel cities
24099,CunninLynguists,Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel s titties
24100,CunninLynguists,Then as soon as I started getting some pride
24101,CunninLynguists,My sister hydroplaned and died on I   
24102,CunninLynguists,In a family full of pride house full of tears
24103,CunninLynguists,Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
24104,CunninLynguists,Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
24105,CunninLynguists,Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
24106,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24107,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24108,CunninLynguists,I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
24109,CunninLynguists,And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
24110,CunninLynguists,Cant grow fond of past memories
24111,CunninLynguists,Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
24112,CunninLynguists,Offended by the mental imagery
24113,CunninLynguists,And suggest livin in poverty was really meant for me
24114,CunninLynguists,Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
24115,CunninLynguists,Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
24116,CunninLynguists,I cant begin to see how to control the flash backs
24117,CunninLynguists,Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
24118,CunninLynguists,Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
24119,CunninLynguists,When I dont perceive what I feel I deserve
24120,CunninLynguists,Being slurred by those not livin in my position
24121,CunninLynguists,My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
24122,CunninLynguists,And when I thought Id risen life freezes the frame
24123,CunninLynguists,So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain
24124,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24125,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24126,CunninLynguists,I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
24127,CunninLynguists,Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
24128,CunninLynguists,You know what blasphemys like cursing at God
24129,CunninLynguists,Cause you aint got shit it hurts and its hard
24130,CunninLynguists,Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
24131,CunninLynguists,Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
24132,CunninLynguists,Most of my lifes a daze got me forever lighting haze
24133,CunninLynguists,Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
24134,CunninLynguists,For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
24135,CunninLynguists,Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
24136,CunninLynguists,Few friends even then most homies is fake
24137,CunninLynguists,Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
24138,CunninLynguists,I went from the block with my fam to college exams
24139,CunninLynguists,But the pressures still there dog Im still scared
24140,CunninLynguists,But I know it will all be right in the end
24141,CunninLynguists,As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen
24142,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24143,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24144,CunninLynguists,Its four o clock on a Sunday morning
24145,CunninLynguists,Who the hell is calling my phone 
24146,CunninLynguists,Waking me up Im stretching and yawning
24147,CunninLynguists,If you had any sense youd leave me alone
24148,CunninLynguists,Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
24149,CunninLynguists,I m in jail I need bail Again the word is bond
24150,CunninLynguists,Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
24151,CunninLynguists,With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
24152,CunninLynguists,Can you free me  fore my prints get back 
24153,CunninLynguists,And they run em through the system and realize that Im black
24154,CunninLynguists,All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack

24261,CunninLynguists,They cant even come face to face and share smiles
24262,CunninLynguists,Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
24263,CunninLynguists,Like she spawned a fucking anti Christ or a Satan infant

24267,CunninLynguists,If he could just set it aside thered be heaven to pay

24276,CunninLynguists,Never taking a second to look at life
24277,CunninLynguists,Bad water in our seeds yall still growing weeds dawg

24279,CunninLynguists,Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
24280,CunninLynguists,Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
24281,CunninLynguists,Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
24282,CunninLynguists,And even though nobodys life is ever perfect
24283,CunninLynguists,You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
24284,CunninLynguists,Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
24285,CunninLynguists,Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
24286,CunninLynguists,People who pimp children are really raping religion
24287,CunninLynguists,The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
24288,CunninLynguists,But now the technology follows me solemnly
24289,CunninLynguists,Building the future laws to my philosophy
24290,CunninLynguists,Alzheimers cutting through like a lobotomy
24291,CunninLynguists,Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
24292,CunninLynguists,Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
24293,CunninLynguists,I survived disease and political crisis
24294,CunninLynguists,By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
24295,CunninLynguists,And now I live vicariously through my kids
24296,CunninLynguists,Like people who love the sport but cant play for shit
24297,CunninLynguists,Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
24298,CunninLynguists,I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
24299,CunninLynguists,Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
24300,CunninLynguists,But just before I vanish as I think Im at the end
24301,CunninLynguists,The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
24302,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24303,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24304,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24305,CunninLynguists,The world is changing day to day
24306,CunninLynguists,It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
24307,CunninLynguists,Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
24308,CunninLynguists,Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
24309,CunninLynguists,I feel weathered but feel like Ive been driving forever
24310,CunninLynguists,Showin up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
24311,CunninLynguists,Ive been better but all things pass
24312,CunninLynguists,This life is taking everything away but youre provided with your past
24313,CunninLynguists,So fuck it  I stick to having dreams on the road
24314,CunninLynguists,But until this dream is done Im gonna keep my eyes closed
24315,CunninLynguists,And breathe breathe when it snows
24316,CunninLynguists,Breathe when Im forced to live a life with a person on a phone
24317,CunninLynguists,Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin
24318,CunninLynguists,Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
24319,CunninLynguists,Cause after the show when the last star shines
24320,CunninLynguists,I can make this all better when I close my eyes
24321,CunninLynguists,Im in another zone where troubles gone
24322,CunninLynguists,Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
24323,CunninLynguists,A place where life is easy for everybody else
24324,CunninLynguists,I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
24325,CunninLynguists,But we dont know it where we dont show it all
24326,CunninLynguists,For life aint protocol under sky over law
24327,CunninLynguists,Im in another space where all the food is good
24328,CunninLynguists,And theres enough for everybody in my neighborhood
24329,CunninLynguists,Where all the grass is blue where we dont know bout green
24330,CunninLynguists,Cause money aint a thing I pinch myself its not a dream
24331,CunninLynguists,Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
24332,CunninLynguists,If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldnt mean a thing
24333,CunninLynguists,Between climbing and finding it not worth it
24334,CunninLynguists,Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
24335,CunninLynguists,Im so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
24336,CunninLynguists,I think of home when I close my eyes
24337,CunninLynguists,So done with the smokes and fries
24338,CunninLynguists,Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
24339,CunninLynguists,Drinks I shouldnt drink things I never write
24340,CunninLynguists,Cities I never liked now its like aight
24341,CunninLynguists,Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
24342,CunninLynguists,Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
24343,CunninLynguists,My work is love no complaints Im fine
24344,CunninLynguists,Its been a long night cant wait to close my eyes
24345,CunninLynguists,I dream of an industry ego less
24346,CunninLynguists,And free from the modern chains with these chains were so deep in love
24347,CunninLynguists,Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
24348,CunninLynguists,Dreaming a publicist wasnt  Gs a month
24349,CunninLynguists,And where its not about numbers and math
24350,CunninLynguists,And I was content with really just a couple of fans
24351,CunninLynguists,And my happiness wasnt relying on tours and a van
24352,CunninLynguists,Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
24353,CunninLynguists,With the front front row stadium packed
24354,CunninLynguists,And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
24355,CunninLynguists,And scream at them  Look at me now look at me man 
24356,CunninLynguists,Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
24357,CunninLynguists,Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
24358,CunninLynguists,Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
24359,CunninLynguists,I woke up and realized it was a dream
24360,CunninLynguists,Wide awake in the rap game but life Im asleep
24361,CunninLynguists,You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
24362,CunninLynguists,I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
24363,CunninLynguists,Part of my shine comes from the distance
24364,CunninLynguists,You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
24365,CunninLynguists,Is this business emotionally invested 
24366,CunninLynguists,Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
24367,CunninLynguists,Love is war sex is a weapon
24368,CunninLynguists,The mind is a mine so watch where youre steppin
24369,CunninLynguists,Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
24370,CunninLynguists,Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
24371,CunninLynguists,Feelings are just filling in this half baked scene
24372,CunninLynguists,To make x rated into nc   
24373,CunninLynguists,Then see everything she got she not shy
24374,CunninLynguists,Our love below so dro we most high
24375,CunninLynguists,Then wears off when what we wears on
24376,CunninLynguists,Again I turn away when what we shares gone
24377,CunninLynguists,If this is not the hardest part
24378,CunninLynguists,If passion dies within routine
24379,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared
24380,CunninLynguists,Could have been fearless and unprepared
24381,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared

24390,CunninLynguists,Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
24391,CunninLynguists,My muse sleeps deep within time
24392,CunninLynguists,I go to her for credit though I need to decline

24958,CunninLynguists,Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
24959,CunninLynguists,Wasnt selfish with them trying to stretch and contort them
24960,CunninLynguists,And didnt let the world get to them first and distort them

25097,CunninLynguists,Bad memories get to me when I drink mad Hennessey
25098,CunninLynguists,Feeling cold and alone even when I got mad friends with me
25099,CunninLynguists,Ill still see something that reminds me of her
25100,CunninLynguists,I got so used to her that without her my mind is a blur
25101,CunninLynguists,She found somebody quick I wont find another for a while
25102,CunninLynguists,She was about to be my wife and mother of my child
25103,CunninLynguists,Its crazy how you can have your life arranged
25104,CunninLynguists,And the day you get engaged you notice shes acting strange
25105,CunninLynguists,Like everythings changed and suddenly you dont trust her just the same
25106,CunninLynguists,Then you find out some other mans been fuckin out her brains
25107,CunninLynguists,Thats when your heart starts to feel the pain
25108,CunninLynguists,So much that you can feel it in your veins and you cant forget her name
25109,CunninLynguists,Thats when you literally go insane
25110,CunninLynguists,And you feel like youre so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says
25111,CunninLynguists,Wise Men say  It looks like rain today 
25112,CunninLynguists,Trickle down the sleepy subway train
25113,CunninLynguists,Ill never understand how a girl can say she loves a man
25114,CunninLynguists,And turn around and have sex with another man
25115,CunninLynguists,I would have much rather been robbed for a hundred grand
25116,CunninLynguists,Than to get interrupted and get a call that shes touching hands
25117,CunninLynguists,With another man Oh God Another man 
25118,CunninLynguists,I cant even cry My tears been dry Thats why its thundering
25119,CunninLynguists,Hard out tonight and its dark and its cold
25120,CunninLynguists,Cause the angels can hear my cry and its all in my soul
25121,CunninLynguists,And all of them know Ive never felt this pain in my past
25122,CunninLynguists,And its ironic the first place we made loves the same as the last
25123,CunninLynguists,In the shower    thats why I put the rain with her name
25124,CunninLynguists,And my power to trust someone again has faded away
25125,CunninLynguists,Other girls want me Tell em it looks like rain today
25126,CunninLynguists,I wallow in my sorrow smoke and watch tapes that we made
25127,CunninLynguists,And one of them tapes is the day I got played like games in arcades
25128,CunninLynguists,The day I almost gave up everything that I gained
25129,CunninLynguists,Its crazy how you can have your life arranged
25130,CunninLynguists,And the day you get engaged you notice shes acting strange
25131,CunninLynguists,Like everythings changed and suddenly its on tape and you crumble
25132,CunninLynguists,Cause you notice on the tape she doesnt kiss you she just fucks you
25133,CunninLynguists,Thats when your heart starts to feel the pain
25134,CunninLynguists,So much that you can feel it in your veins and you cant forget her name
25135,CunninLynguists,Thats when you literally go insane
25136,CunninLynguists,And you feel like youre so sad you make it rain and then a song plays that says

25138,CunninLynguists,Please help us protect what s right  Amen 
25139,CunninLynguists, There aint nothin in this world that could take your place 
25140,CunninLynguists,Gather your thoughts gather around
25141,CunninLynguists,Painted arrangements mixed from a pallet of sound
25142,CunninLynguists,A casket froze in indigo royal and profound
25143,CunninLynguists,Many stems like hymns once blossomed from ground
25144,CunninLynguists,But while the reaper is king we carry the crown
25145,CunninLynguists,We weigh it out dreaming screaming or close to even
25146,CunninLynguists,In this sense nobodys perfect nobody is worthless
25147,CunninLynguists,The systems imperfect maybe we should measure in purpose
25148,CunninLynguists,What is yours What is mine When do we serve it 
25149,CunninLynguists,Being hood aint the absence of good

25152,CunninLynguists,Speak choices with no when or a where are you aware I dont think so
25153,CunninLynguists,Unless your cup runneth over and you still sip slow
25154,CunninLynguists,Or guzzle til nothing complaining when you dont get mo

25157,CunninLynguists,There aint nothing in this world that can take your place
25158,CunninLynguists,It appears its just for you
25159,CunninLynguists,There aint nothing in this world that can take your place
25160,CunninLynguists,Faith we treat it like a four letter word
25161,CunninLynguists,While fear we shout it through the ghettos and burbs
25162,CunninLynguists,Hear me my Lord come settle my nerves
25163,CunninLynguists,I pray these words bring honor as the heavens observe
25164,CunninLynguists,And to the sky where the birds will testify
25165,CunninLynguists,Freedom s a state of mind be free any day or time
25166,CunninLynguists,Reality will make you doubt your actuality
25167,CunninLynguists,The truest fallacy is man can t change how he sees
25168,CunninLynguists,So it s death to reason it s left the legions
25169,CunninLynguists,Wondering where to pledge allegiance
25170,CunninLynguists,This is my letter to Ephesians the rest we need them
25171,CunninLynguists,Through death the best are leavin 
25172,CunninLynguists,What are we suppose to do

25176,CunninLynguists,I dont know whats realer the struggle and the strain
25177,CunninLynguists,Or the guilt that can be built within when making gains
25178,CunninLynguists,Aint no cheatin death you cant lie to life
25179,CunninLynguists,Plus everything about you s hiding in these satellites
25180,CunninLynguists,Outside of the one day that Adam had it right

25184,CunninLynguists,One nation under a God kickin us out
25185,CunninLynguists, Cause America took and takes the infamous route

25716,CunninLynguists,I m trippin like I m eatin the fungi
25717,CunninLynguists,Leaving me cornered like the puss that crusts in ones eye
25718,CunninLynguists,Theres no light just never ending night
25719,CunninLynguists,And the weathers like a hurricane when land is in its sight
25720,CunninLynguists,The sand within my hourglass could vanish any moment
25721,CunninLynguists,And Im trying to read the signs within the symbols and the omens
25722,CunninLynguists,From the motions of the sea to the color of the dark
25723,CunninLynguists,This ocean of my dreams was more than cover for the sharks
25724,CunninLynguists,Recovering these parts is like discovering my art
25725,CunninLynguists,I wonder as I wander through my heart
25726,CunninLynguists,Cus it starts a dream defferred
25727,CunninLynguists,A clipped wing on a white dove
25728,CunninLynguists,Seems absurd a smudge on a white glove
25729,CunninLynguists,Not seen nor heard like screams from the nights lungs
25730,CunninLynguists,Cling to words so much that you wont budge
25731,CunninLynguists,Fiends in herds who yearn for the white crumbs
25732,CunninLynguists,Getting high like the city sky when it lights up
25733,CunninLynguists,It hits your mind with the right stuff
25734,CunninLynguists,To keep you blind with a slight buzz
25735,CunninLynguists,The mind is like a puzzle that could never be completed
25736,CunninLynguists,We scuffle through its pieces strugglin for peace its
25737,CunninLynguists,Hard for us to sleep and even harder to awake
25738,CunninLynguists,The image in my mirror s gettin harder to relate
25739,CunninLynguists,I see me harbouring my hate and bartering with grace
25740,CunninLynguists,But I couldnt be farther from my faith or my face
25741,CunninLynguists,Through this waste of my mind may I find direction
25742,CunninLynguists,Im a waste of my time if I dont find its lessons
25743,CunninLynguists,So all welcome to this generous helping of self reflection
25744,CunninLynguists,Night thoughts brought to life with incandescence
25745,CunninLynguists,As the world twirls on the tip of our index
25746,CunninLynguists,Staring into space one s vision is endless
25747,CunninLynguists,But glaring at the ground you can see where the end is
25748,CunninLynguists,So just close pupils and be pupils and listen
25749,CunninLynguists,The headset s your desk the test is what s missin
25750,CunninLynguists,Disect these notes of quotes of keys written
25751,CunninLynguists,Dont worry about this dirty south til its mud floods ya front stoop
25752,CunninLynguists,Aces and acres of haters growing out the same root
25753,CunninLynguists,That hit you quicker than poverty in two major arteries
25754,CunninLynguists,Havin you movin and softshoe in like who made you property
25755,CunninLynguists,Black face and sambos tied for last place
25756,CunninLynguists,Let facts state we like Wildcats in a rat race
25757,CunninLynguists,At that rate the state stay ahead of tomorrow
25758,CunninLynguists,Standing out like mount Kilimanjaro
25759,CunninLynguists,So through this Bluegrass follow sorrow
25760,CunninLynguists,Blacker then the ghetto you fear
25761,CunninLynguists,You disappear like the future of the ghetto you near
25762,CunninLynguists,Where index fingers bring the heavy metal you hear
25763,CunninLynguists,Block stars loading guns as fiends battle for crumbs
25764,CunninLynguists,Come travel through slums try politickin with pushas
25765,CunninLynguists,Made block decisions while mothafuckas overlooked us
25766,CunninLynguists,Under the radar like helicopters on the sly
25767,CunninLynguists,Crept in with hoods on KKKY
25768,CunninLynguists,KKKY more then what you thank it is
25769,CunninLynguists,Aint just tobacco some bourbon and where horse racin live
25770,CunninLynguists,This is for my Mark Makers I keep my flask tipped

25772,CunninLynguists,Dont try to play Mike Vick and stick a dog in this fight
25773,CunninLynguists,Ya art of loud bark dont veto your mosquitoish bite
25774,CunninLynguists,The mcs too dark the producer too white
25775,CunninLynguists,Fam the lyrics too loose the beats is to tight
25776,CunninLynguists,We parry blows we bury foes through stereos
25777,CunninLynguists,Keep an aerial view over scenarios
25778,CunninLynguists,Some niggas that move spirts like a liquor store
25779,CunninLynguists,AA after   steps you back to get some more

25794,CunninLynguists,Grace that human males cant feel
25795,CunninLynguists,Unless he builds with a female until time stands still
25796,CunninLynguists,When we take off our shells and chill
25797,CunninLynguists,All before fingers learn bodies like we got blindman skill
25798,CunninLynguists,She speaks no evil but says whatever
25799,CunninLynguists,After Shaking up bed feathers still prays together
25800,CunninLynguists,On a parlay flip permenant private party trip
25801,CunninLynguists,The next Ruby and Ossie Davis Im talking great shit

25811,CunninLynguists,Spent Pubescent years blessed with peers I could trust
25812,CunninLynguists,Spinning records to a game of checkers after dusk
25813,CunninLynguists,Laughter rushes out of mouth clutchin my stomach abs burning
25814,CunninLynguists,From fast learning not cash earning

25836,CunninLynguists,Don t mean to sound cold got my soul singing baritone
25837,CunninLynguists,Of those in this winter with no mink or folk
25838,CunninLynguists,Weathering this desert with no drink to cope
25839,CunninLynguists,Some chain smoke with no link or hope
25840,CunninLynguists,You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
25841,CunninLynguists,The fastest can t run from who they are
25842,CunninLynguists,I d run from self but no man can run that far
25843,CunninLynguists,Turn the page eventually I hit a certain age
25844,CunninLynguists,Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you re afraid
25845,CunninLynguists,Success can often be a perfect cage
25846,CunninLynguists,Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
25847,CunninLynguists,A prisoner trapped in the regret
25848,CunninLynguists,Cuz the ego can t keep up if they happen to reject it
25849,CunninLynguists,Sometimes you want so bad to be respected
25850,CunninLynguists,Goin after it  til you ve left your happiness neglected
25851,CunninLynguists,I ve seen the weakness in grown men
25852,CunninLynguists,Playing games with their pain they cheat but they don t win
25853,CunninLynguists,Seen  em feed the needle deep into their own skin
25854,CunninLynguists,Tryna find a fleeting bit of peace in that moment
25855,CunninLynguists,More success to fix what s left
25856,CunninLynguists,Take an even bigger risk like after this I ll rest
25857,CunninLynguists,Til he painted with the razor on his wrist a red

25859,CunninLynguists,I m Bustin Loose no Wilder just a Pryor  prior 
25860,CunninLynguists,And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
25861,CunninLynguists,Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
25862,CunninLynguists,Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
25863,CunninLynguists,Meet a fan kick it witcha take a picture
25864,CunninLynguists,Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister
25865,CunninLynguists,Realer than steel I da grabbed before I picked up a pen and a pad

25874,CunninLynguists,Oh I would stand by you  Word  
25875,CunninLynguists,If it would help I d even die for you
25876,CunninLynguists,I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
25877,CunninLynguists,Over against my own will surrounded by illusions
25878,CunninLynguists,Fighting to stay positive however losing
25879,CunninLynguists,Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
25880,CunninLynguists,The human heart does more than just pump blood
25881,CunninLynguists,It pumps love at least I know that mine did once
25882,CunninLynguists,But a large piece of it was undone
25883,CunninLynguists,And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
25884,CunninLynguists,Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
25885,CunninLynguists,Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
25886,CunninLynguists,But be certain of your faith and you ll acquire the ability
25887,CunninLynguists,To expose witches and burn them at the stake
25888,CunninLynguists,I m looking for love I m done searching for a date
25889,CunninLynguists,Ive been alone for years but it s worth it if you wait
25890,CunninLynguists,Personally late s better than never at all
25891,CunninLynguists,So when I brush myself off whenever I fall tell me
25892,CunninLynguists,Oh yeah That s what the last one said
25893,CunninLynguists,Unfortunately I was mad misled
25894,CunninLynguists,I ran on E til no more gas was left
25895,CunninLynguists,The most I got from her was ass and bread
25896,CunninLynguists,But trust was lost like Kanye s fashion sense
25897,CunninLynguists,Accidents happen when you live with the weak
25898,CunninLynguists,But it s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
25899,CunninLynguists,That s enough reason to get into beef
25900,CunninLynguists,Throw all your spouse s shit on the street quit  retreat
25901,CunninLynguists,But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
25902,CunninLynguists,So please for my sake stay by me this earth is cold
25903,CunninLynguists,And I m freezing like I ve been lying in dirt and snow
25904,CunninLynguists,I ve searched the globe for a person who knows
25905,CunninLynguists,The true meaning of love you could be the one
25906,CunninLynguists,If you mean what you say we could link up
25907,CunninLynguists,And use what we learned from our exes in the past
25908,CunninLynguists,But wait cause I got another question to ask and that s 
25909,CunninLynguists,Sounds good and if you mean it I ll hook up with you this evening
25910,CunninLynguists,Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
25911,CunninLynguists,The touch of a king when you re my queen
25912,CunninLynguists,And trust is the the key in every relationship
25913,CunninLynguists,But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
25914,CunninLynguists,But looks can be deceiving
25915,CunninLynguists,Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
25916,CunninLynguists,So don t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
25917,CunninLynguists,That s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
25918,CunninLynguists,But the first line of this song already explained
25919,CunninLynguists,That my arteries were drained now all of me is tame
25920,CunninLynguists,So stay beside me cause I don t wanna be estranged
25921,CunninLynguists,As soon as time found them they were saved
25922,CunninLynguists,And still lay there to this day
25923,CunninLynguists,But if this should ever change
25924,CunninLynguists,Just stay and I mma do the same
25925,CunninLynguists,The darkness of the night has gone
25926,CunninLynguists,Crystal drops of morning dew are gone

25944,CunninLynguists,Underfunded school headstone or a back tat
25945,CunninLynguists,Located in a trap that snap when the rat snack is  gone 
25946,CunninLynguists,No brown on the streets where baristas rule
25947,CunninLynguists,And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
25948,CunninLynguists,For the tenants thats in it
25949,CunninLynguists,But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
25950,CunninLynguists,To a brand new prison they can sit til the bars are all  gone 
25951,CunninLynguists,They trying to get us out the hood them people want us  gone 
25952,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone 
25953,CunninLynguists,Crack a Corona just zone while Im sipping on it

25961,CunninLynguists,And the people want rebellion
25962,CunninLynguists,But their Innocence is  gone 
25963,CunninLynguists,And what are we to teach them 
25964,CunninLynguists,When all the grannies are beneath them
25965,CunninLynguists,And the families are divided
25966,CunninLynguists,Searching but I ve been told the silver lining is  gone 
25967,CunninLynguists,This is when fear talks ears off
25968,CunninLynguists,Many corporations calculate what a tear cost
25969,CunninLynguists,Morals break down like they biodegradable
25970,CunninLynguists,Too keep the faith or give it up
25971,CunninLynguists,Are the lights that shine in the darkest times  Gone 
25972,CunninLynguists,I m hoping this as bad as it gets
25973,CunninLynguists,They trying to kick us out the hood niggas want us  gone

26272,CunninLynguists,Fumblin with sweat on my fingers somethin impetuous lingers
26273,CunninLynguists,Become infected with feelings so Im electing this evil
26274,CunninLynguists,To end my life without reason cause Im indicted for treason
26275,CunninLynguists,Closin my eyes and Im leakin draggin the knife till Im bleedin
26276,CunninLynguists,Cause its the life that Im seekin feels only right that Im meetin
26277,CunninLynguists,With Jesus seeking redemption but he dont want my repentance
26278,CunninLynguists,For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
26279,CunninLynguists,Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
26280,CunninLynguists,The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessings
26281,CunninLynguists,Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
26282,CunninLynguists,Parents repeatedly sentenced heroin needles on dressers
26283,CunninLynguists,They use to feed their infection I cant repeat indescretions
26284,CunninLynguists,So I pause for reflection long for honest affection
26285,CunninLynguists,And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
26286,CunninLynguists,If you knew where my head is when Im doing these records
26287,CunninLynguists,Youd never listen to my music again I cant let you     
26288,CunninLynguists,I will know how things can be    
26289,CunninLynguists, I want to live a real life     I dont want to dream any longer 
26290,CunninLynguists,If we gonna start from scratch you start with wax

26294,CunninLynguists,The agreement turned cement
26295,CunninLynguists,Hip Hop the vinyl frontier
26296,CunninLynguists,Two turntables a mic and a cold stereo DJ one MC the imperial
26297,CunninLynguists,Many many put their muse to it
26298,CunninLynguists,Sent bop sent rock sent blues through it
26299,CunninLynguists,From classical to jazz we can who s who it
26300,CunninLynguists,Or blow the dust off and groove to it
26301,CunninLynguists,You know that crackle give the best high
26302,CunninLynguists,Give me a needle a cartridge a partridge some tree   s and a    let it be
26303,CunninLynguists,A new format hit the scene like way back
26304,CunninLynguists,It was smaller and more convenient than   track
26305,CunninLynguists,You could pop it in your car on a long drive
26306,CunninLynguists,Play the album or fast forward to song five
26307,CunninLynguists,If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
26308,CunninLynguists,It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
26309,CunninLynguists,Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
26310,CunninLynguists,When they was on the air I was on the pause button
26311,CunninLynguists,I had the best taste but I aint trying to cause nothing
26312,CunninLynguists,Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws
26313,CunninLynguists,Cats used to battle this shit used to cause wars
26314,CunninLynguists,We would trade tapes that was the best it could be
26315,CunninLynguists,Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
26316,CunninLynguists,Having the best tapes was like a status symbol
26317,CunninLynguists,The yellow tape purple tape to the baddest demo
26318,CunninLynguists,Battles travel from the Bronx to Baltimore
26319,CunninLynguists,They would stand by the speaker to record them all
26320,CunninLynguists,Them same tapes that was labeled with a thick marker
26321,CunninLynguists,Made the neighbourhood rappers want to spit sharper
26322,CunninLynguists,If my tape pop trust I was ready man
26323,CunninLynguists,A razor blade scotch tape and a steady hand
26324,CunninLynguists,My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life
26325,CunninLynguists,My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle
26326,CunninLynguists,Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the beat
26327,CunninLynguists,Stab the repeat button and keep running
26328,CunninLynguists,And thats something you cant get from tape dubbing

26534,CunninLynguists,I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
26535,CunninLynguists,But so many times I fall in between the lines
26536,CunninLynguists,Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
26537,CunninLynguists,If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight

26553,CunninLynguists,Some type of indication of what state my life is in 
26554,CunninLynguists,They keep piping in elevator music
26555,CunninLynguists,Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
26556,CunninLynguists,When I reflect back and recollect that

26570,CunninLynguists,Its not fair the way you challenge me
26571,CunninLynguists,Or the silent way my talents be
26572,CunninLynguists,Hidden inside these translations
26573,CunninLynguists,Emancipation as I try to dab the slate clean
26574,CunninLynguists,Futile attempts to make my fate glean
26575,CunninLynguists,It makes me want to fall reclusive
26576,CunninLynguists,And rip the tallest loose leaf

105341,Royce Da 59,Uh my name is Ryan Daniel Montgomery
105342,Royce Da 59,Recovering alcoholic I grew up on  Mile
105343,Royce Da 59,Uh Im not a gangster drug dealer or thug nigga

105345,Royce Da 59,Now sometime around   I found my calling
105346,Royce Da 59,And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
105347,Royce Da 59,Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
105348,Royce Da 59,But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
105349,Royce Da 59,My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
105350,Royce Da 59,Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
105351,Royce Da 59,My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter

105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice

105388,Royce Da 59,Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us

105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see

105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show

105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out

105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce

109995,Scarface,Just one time I wanna clear my mind the silence seems so loud
109996,Scarface,If I could I would fly away and live my life beyond the grey cloud

110117,Scarface,They wanna learn the game from an old school
110118,Scarface,I give em strategies to sleep on
110119,Scarface,So when they put me in the grave they could keep on
110120,Scarface,Now first on your check list

110128,Scarface,Its hard enough trynna get by
110129,Scarface,Day to day struggling with shit so you get high
110130,Scarface,And staying drunk on the regular
110131,Scarface,Talking dope talk on your cellular
110132,Scarface,But in this game thats a no no
110133,Scarface,The streets aint the only ones watching taking photos

110140,Scarface,And we dont talk to police
110141,Scarface,Thats the number one rule on the streets

110143,Scarface,Nigga keep the streets quiet
110144,Scarface,You dont upstrap unless you have to
110145,Scarface,Bullshit with these niggas and they clap you
110146,Scarface,Dig two graves just in case its two bodies
110147,Scarface,And never bring a stick to a gunfight
110148,Scarface,One shot one kill you get one life
110149,Scarface,And shitting where you sleep aint an option
110150,Scarface,People knowing where you sleep thats a problem
110151,Scarface,You got to watch these niggas
110152,Scarface,They aint your home boys not these niggas
110153,Scarface,First chance you call sleep they could murk you
110154,Scarface,So dont put squares in your circle
110155,Scarface,Cos these streets dont love nobody
110156,Scarface,You gotta pay attention to the signs Johnny
110157,Scarface,If you a weak nigga dont try to play hard
110158,Scarface,Better keep your punk ass out the yard
110159,Scarface,And dont get fronted just avoid that
110160,Scarface,But if you have to pay them boys back
110161,Scarface,Cos niggas aint playing its a drought
110162,Scarface,The border is closed the cash running out
110163,Scarface,And broke mother fuckers make the best crooks

110167,Scarface,And last but not least when you make that money
110168,Scarface,Keep it low pro dont say shit dummy

110178,Scarface,And then be surprised when you catch a life sentence
110179,Scarface,The game is a thing that you boys should be proud of
110180,Scarface,But once you in it its hard to get out of
110181,Scarface,And greed will kill a nigga like a gun do
