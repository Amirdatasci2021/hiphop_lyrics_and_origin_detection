47475,Ice Cube,A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
47476,Ice Cube,No you cant find the shit in a handbook
47477,Ice Cube,Take a close look at a rap crook
47478,Ice Cube,Rule number one get yourself a gun
47479,Ice Cube,A nine in your assll be fine
47480,Ice Cube,Keep it in your glove compartment
47481,Ice Cube,Cause jackers  yo they love to start shit
47482,Ice Cube,Now if youre white you can trust the police
47483,Ice Cube,But if youre black they aint nothin but beasts
47484,Ice Cube,Dont make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
47485,Ice Cube,Answer all questions and thats your first lesson
47486,Ice Cube,In South Central yeah thats how you survive

47910,Ice Cube,Cuz I been shot to this day I pack my steel
47911,Ice Cube,Cuz I was born in a certain territory
47912,Ice Cube,Where you dont talk only the streets tell stories
47913,Ice Cube,With blue and red bandanas on the street
47914,Ice Cube,And if you slippin youll be six feet deep

47928,Ice Cube,But when I do gotta put my gat in his mouth
47929,Ice Cube,Pump seventeen rounds make his brains hang out
47930,Ice Cube,Cause the shit he did was uncalled for
