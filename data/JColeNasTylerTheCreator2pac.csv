55225,J Cole,Im writing this because me and the devil had a dance
55226,J Cole,Now I see death around the corner pologizing in advance
55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
55301,J Cole,Thats the way I wished my family lived
55302,J Cole,But my granny crib was in the jects 
55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only
55313,J Cole,Dont you ever scratch or disrespect it
55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
55322,J Cole,With lil Zach and Cole World barely one years old

56319,J Cole,Justifying that half ass shit he dropped we always buy it
56320,J Cole,When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
56321,J Cole,Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
56323,J Cole,Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
56324,J Cole,Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
56325,J Cole,The type of nigga swear he real but all around hims fake
56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him
56328,J Cole,So he grows out of control
56329,J Cole,Into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
56330,J Cole,Maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas
56331,J Cole,Based off the words they be rappin

56351,J Cole,Always worried bout the critics who aint ever fuckin did it
56352,J Cole,I write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
56353,J Cole,But in a sense I can relate the need to be great
56354,J Cole,Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
56355,J Cole,Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me 
56359,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
56360,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this be like this
56361,J Cole,False prophets  La la la la la la la la la  
56362,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this

56364,J Cole,They talk about being a man so much
56365,J Cole,I finally understand that they aint even sure
56366,J Cole,Bout who they are and why they do this
56367,J Cole,Guess Im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
56368,J Cole,My highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
56369,J Cole,Ive seen in my life I be fiendin to write
56370,J Cole,Songs that raise the hair on my arms
56371,J Cole,My lowest moments came from tryin too hard
56372,J Cole,To impress some niggas that couldnt care if Im on
56373,J Cole,Therefore from here on out my hair grow out
56374,J Cole,I care nothin bout opinions
56375,J Cole,I wanna give hope like the fountains you throw pennies in
56376,J Cole,Hit the store take your diss make your wish
56377,J Cole,This is dedicated to the ones that listen to me on some faithful shit
56378,J Cole,But the real God is in you not the music you coppin

56391,J Cole,Born sinner was never born to be perfect
56392,J Cole,Sucker for women licking they lips and holding these purses
56393,J Cole,Back when we ran the streets who would think we grow to be murderers
56394,J Cole,Teachers treated niggas as if they totally worthless
56395,J Cole,I saw but never noticed that a college point is right to
56396,J Cole, Be all that you can be posters
56397,J Cole,Rest in peace to Tiffany I dont know if this is the realest shit I wrote
