39382,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39383,Eminem,I went in headfirst never thinkin about who what I said hurt
39384,Eminem,In what verse my mom probably got it the worst
39385,Eminem,The brunt of it but as stubborn as we are did I take it too far 
39386,Eminem, Cleanin Out My Closet and all them other songs
39387,Eminem,But regardless I dont hate you  cause Ma
39388,Eminem,Youre still beautiful to me  cause youre my mom
39389,Eminem,Though far be it from you to be calm
39390,Eminem,Our house was Vietnam Desert Storm
39391,Eminem,And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
39392,Eminem,Equivalent to chemical warfare
39393,Eminem,And forever we could drag this on and on
39394,Eminem,But agree to disagree that gift for me
39395,Eminem,Up under the Christmas tree dont mean shit to me
39396,Eminem,Youre kickin me out Its   degrees

39398,Eminem,Ma let me grab my fucking coat 
39399,Eminem,Anything to have each others goats
39400,Eminem,Why we always at each others throats 
39401,Eminem,Especially when Dad he fucked us both
39402,Eminem,Were in the same fuckin boat
39403,Eminem,Youd think thatd make us close  nope 
39404,Eminem,Further away it drove us but together headlights shine
39405,Eminem,And a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
39406,Eminem,Back to grandmas house its straight up the road
39407,Eminem,And I was the man of the house the oldest
39408,Eminem,So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
39409,Eminem,Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
39410,Eminem,And thats when I realized you were sick
39411,Eminem,And it wasnt fixable or changeable
39412,Eminem,And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though but 
39413,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39414,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39415,Eminem, Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
39416,Eminem, Cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
39417,Eminem,But Im sorry Momma for  Cleanin Out My Closet 
39418,Eminem,At the time I was angry rightfully Maybe so
39419,Eminem,Never meant that far to take it though
39420,Eminem, Cause now I know its not your fault and Im not makin jokes
39421,Eminem,That song I no longer play at shows
39422,Eminem,And I cringe every time its on the radio
39423,Eminem,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
39424,Eminem,And all the medicine you fed us and
39425,Eminem,How I just wanted you to taste your own
39426,Eminem,But now the medications takin over
39427,Eminem,And your mental states deterioratin slow
39428,Eminem,And Im way too old to cry the shit is painful though
39429,Eminem,But Ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo
39430,Eminem,All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
39431,Eminem,Foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
39432,Eminem,But I love you Debbie Mathers
39433,Eminem,Oh what a tangled web we have  cause
39434,Eminem,One thing I never asked was
39435,Eminem,Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
39436,Eminem,Fuck it I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
39437,Eminem,But Ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
39438,Eminem,Owned a collection of maps
39439,Eminem,And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
39440,Eminem,If someone ever moved em from me
39441,Eminem,That you coulda bet your asses
39442,Eminem,If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap em
39443,Eminem,And although one has only met their grandma once
39444,Eminem,You pulled up in our drive one night
39445,Eminem,As we were leavin to get some hamburgers
39446,Eminem,Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you
39447,Eminem,And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
39448,Eminem,Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
39449,Eminem,I saw your headlights as I looked back
39450,Eminem,And Im mad I didnt get the chance to
39451,Eminem,Thank you for being my mom and my dad
39452,Eminem,So Mom please accept this as a
39453,Eminem,Tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to
39454,Eminem,Get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to
39455,Eminem,Lay it fore Im dead the stewardess said to fasten
39456,Eminem,My seatbelt I guess were crashin
39457,Eminem,So if Im not dreamin I hope you get this message that
39458,Eminem,I will always love you from afar  cause youre my mom
39459,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39460,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39461,Eminem,I want a new life  start over 
39462,Eminem,One without a cause  clean slate 
39463,Eminem,Well no matter what the cost
39464,Eminem,And if the plane goes down
39465,Eminem,Or if the crew cant wake me up
39466,Eminem,Well just know that Im alright
39467,Eminem,Oh even if theres songs to sing
39468,Eminem,Well my children will carry me
39469,Eminem,Because I put my faith in my little girls
39470,Eminem,So I never say goodbye cruel world
39471,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39472,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39473,Eminem,Cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak  Yo left yo left yo left right left 
39474,Eminem,And when you feel weak  Yo left 
39475,Eminem,You feel like you wanna just give up  Yo left yo left 
39476,Eminem,But you gotta search within you  Right left 
39477,Eminem,Tryna find that inner strength  Yo left yo left 
39478,Eminem,And just pull that shit out of you  Yo left 
39479,Eminem,And get that motivation to not give up  Right left yo left 
39480,Eminem,And not be a quitter no matter how bad you wanna just fall  Yo left yo left 
39481,Eminem,Flat on your face and collapse  Right left 
39482,Eminem,Til I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em
39483,Eminem,Til the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
39484,Eminem, Cause when I am not then Ima stop pennin em
39485,Eminem,And I am not hip hop and Im just not Eminem
39486,Eminem,Subliminal thoughts when Ima stop sendin em 
39487,Eminem,Women are caught in webs spin em and hock venom
39488,Eminem,Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
39489,Eminem,Amoxicillins just not real enough
39490,Eminem,The criminal cop killin hip hop villain
39491,Eminem,A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
39492,Eminem,Youre comin with me feel it or not
39493,Eminem,Youre gonna fear it like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
39494,Eminem,You hear it a lot lyrics to shock

39496,Eminem,Fa shizzel my wizzel this is the plot listen up
39497,Eminem,You bizzels forgot Slizzel does not give a fuck
39498,Eminem,Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39499,Eminem,Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39500,Eminem,Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39501,Eminem,Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39502,Eminem, Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39503,Eminem, The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39504,Eminem, Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39505,Eminem, Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39506,Eminem,Music is like magic theres a certain feelin you get
39507,Eminem,When you real and you spit and people are feelin your shit
39508,Eminem,This is your moment and every single minute you spend
39509,Eminem,Tryna hold on to it cause you may never get it again
39510,Eminem,So while youre in it try to get as much shit as you can
39511,Eminem,And when your run is over just admit when its at its end
39512,Eminem,Cause Im at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
39513,Eminem,I got a list heres the order of my list that its in
39514,Eminem,It goes Reggie JayZ  Pac and Biggie
39515,Eminem,Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me
39516,Eminem,But in this industry Im the cause of a lot of envy
39517,Eminem,So when Im not put on this list the shit does not offend me
39518,Eminem,Thats why you see me walk around like nothings botherin me
39519,Eminem,Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
39520,Eminem,You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
39521,Eminem,The presss wet dream like Bobby and Whitney  Nate hit me 
39522,Eminem,Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39523,Eminem,Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39524,Eminem,Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps

39526,Eminem, Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39527,Eminem, The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39528,Eminem, Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39529,Eminem, Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39530,Eminem,Soon as a verse starts I eat at an MCs heart
39531,Eminem,What is he thinking How not to go against me smart
39532,Eminem,And its absurd how people hang on every word
39533,Eminem,Ill probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
39534,Eminem,But Ill never be served my spot is forever reserved
39535,Eminem,If I ever leave Earth that would be the death of me first
39536,Eminem, Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse
39537,Eminem,Thats why Im clever when I put together every verse
39538,Eminem,My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
39539,Eminem,I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
39540,Eminem,But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles
39541,Eminem,The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
39542,Eminem,So this is like a full blown attack Im launchin at em
39543,Eminem,The track is on some battlin raps who wants some static 
39544,Eminem, Cause I dont really think that the fact that Im Slim matters
39545,Eminem,A plaque and platinum status is whack if Im not the baddest so
39546,Eminem,Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39547,Eminem,Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39548,Eminem,Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39549,Eminem,Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39550,Eminem, Until the roof Til the roof comes off til the lights go out
39551,Eminem, The roof comes off Til my legs give out cant shut my mouth
39552,Eminem, Until my legs Til the smoke clears out am I high Perhaps
39553,Eminem, Give out from underneath me Ima rip this shit til my bones collapse
39554,Eminem,Until the roof  until the roof 
39555,Eminem,The roof comes off  the roof comes off 
39556,Eminem,Until my legs  until my legs 
39557,Eminem,Give out from  underneath me 
39558,Eminem,I will not fall I will stand tall

40136,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
40137,Eminem, Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind bogglin
40138,Eminem, Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
40139,Eminem,Bothers me but not my father he said sayonara

40151,Eminem,What about them rhymes Ive been jottin 
40152,Eminem,They are kind of giving me confidence
40153,Eminem,Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
40154,Eminem,Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx 
40155,Eminem,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
40156,Eminem,Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eye balled him

40254,Eminem,And dont even realize what you did believe me you
40255,Eminem,Ive been through the wringer

40262,Eminem,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
40265,Eminem,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
40266,Eminem,Id shoot for the moon but Im too busy gazin at stars
40267,Eminem,I m not afraid  I m not afraid

40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40376,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40377,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40378,Eminem,Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for 
40379,Eminem,Not the expression no literally give an arm for
40380,Eminem,When they know theyre your heart and you know you were their armor
40381,Eminem,And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
40382,Eminem,But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you

40681,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
40709,Eminem,This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
40710,Eminem,Im still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute  cause 
40711,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
40733,Eminem,But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
40734,Eminem,That we just inherited   s beef with Murder Inc 
40735,Eminem,And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
40736,Eminem,We still have soldiers thats on the front line
40737,Eminem,Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
40738,Eminem,Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
40748,Eminem,Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
40749,Eminem,Off at your jaws well then I can  cause frankly Im sick of talkin
40750,Eminem,Im not goin to let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience
40751,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40752,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40753,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40754,Eminem,You used to say that Id never be
40755,Eminem,Nothin without you and Id believe
40756,Eminem,Im shot in the lungs I gasp I cant breathe
