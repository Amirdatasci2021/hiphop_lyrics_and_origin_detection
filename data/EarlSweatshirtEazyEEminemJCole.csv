39389,Eminem,Though far be it from you to be calm
39390,Eminem,Our house was Vietnam Desert Storm

39403,Eminem,Youd think thatd make us close  nope 
39404,Eminem,Further away it drove us but together headlights shine
39405,Eminem,And a car full of belongings still got a ways to go
39406,Eminem,Back to grandmas house its straight up the road
39407,Eminem,And I was the man of the house the oldest
39408,Eminem,So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
39409,Eminem,Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
39410,Eminem,And thats when I realized you were sick
39411,Eminem,And it wasnt fixable or changeable
39412,Eminem,And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though but 
39413,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39414,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39415,Eminem, Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
39416,Eminem, Cause you aint even get to witness your grandbabies grow
39417,Eminem,But Im sorry Momma for  Cleanin Out My Closet 
39418,Eminem,At the time I was angry rightfully Maybe so
39419,Eminem,Never meant that far to take it though
39420,Eminem, Cause now I know its not your fault and Im not makin jokes
39421,Eminem,That song I no longer play at shows
39422,Eminem,And I cringe every time its on the radio
39423,Eminem,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
39424,Eminem,And all the medicine you fed us and
39425,Eminem,How I just wanted you to taste your own
39426,Eminem,But now the medications takin over
39427,Eminem,And your mental states deterioratin slow
39428,Eminem,And Im way too old to cry the shit is painful though
39429,Eminem,But Ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo
39430,Eminem,All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both
39431,Eminem,Foster care that cross you bear few may be as heavy as yours
39432,Eminem,But I love you Debbie Mathers
39433,Eminem,Oh what a tangled web we have  cause
39434,Eminem,One thing I never asked was
39435,Eminem,Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
39436,Eminem,Fuck it I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
39437,Eminem,But Ida flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus
39438,Eminem,Owned a collection of maps
39439,Eminem,And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
39440,Eminem,If someone ever moved em from me
39441,Eminem,That you coulda bet your asses
39442,Eminem,If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap em
39443,Eminem,And although one has only met their grandma once
39444,Eminem,You pulled up in our drive one night
39445,Eminem,As we were leavin to get some hamburgers
39446,Eminem,Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you
39447,Eminem,And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
39448,Eminem,Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
39449,Eminem,I saw your headlights as I looked back
39450,Eminem,And Im mad I didnt get the chance to
39451,Eminem,Thank you for being my mom and my dad
39452,Eminem,So Mom please accept this as a
39453,Eminem,Tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to
39454,Eminem,Get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to
39455,Eminem,Lay it fore Im dead the stewardess said to fasten
39456,Eminem,My seatbelt I guess were crashin
39457,Eminem,So if Im not dreamin I hope you get this message that
39458,Eminem,I will always love you from afar  cause youre my mom
39459,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39460,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39461,Eminem,I want a new life  start over 
39462,Eminem,One without a cause  clean slate 
39463,Eminem,Well no matter what the cost

39468,Eminem,Well my children will carry me
39469,Eminem,Because I put my faith in my little girls
39470,Eminem,So I never say goodbye cruel world
39471,Eminem,Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
39472,Eminem,Maybe we took this too far
39473,Eminem,Cause sometimes you just feel tired feel weak  Yo left yo left yo left right left 
39474,Eminem,And when you feel weak  Yo left

39920,Eminem,Daddys always on the move Mommas always on the news
39921,Eminem,I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems
39922,Eminem,The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
39923,Eminem,All the things growing up as Daddy that he had to see
39924,Eminem,Daddy dont want you to see but you see just as much as he did
39925,Eminem,We did not plan it to be this way your mother and me
39926,Eminem,But things have got so bad between us I dont see us ever being
39927,Eminem,Together ever again like we used to be when we was teenagers
39928,Eminem,But then of course everything always happens for a reason
39929,Eminem,I guess it was never meant to be but its just something
39930,Eminem,We have no control over and thats what destiny is
39931,Eminem,But no more worries rest your head and go to sleep

39939,Eminem,It may seem a little crazy pretty baby
39940,Eminem,But I promise Mommas gon be alright
39941,Eminem,I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
39942,Eminem,Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck em under the tree
39943,Eminem,And said some of em were from me cause Daddy couldnt buy em
39944,Eminem,Ill never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
39945,Eminem,Cause Daddy felt like a bum see Daddy had a job
39946,Eminem,But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
39947,Eminem,And at the time every house that we lived in
39948,Eminem,Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
39949,Eminem,And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
39950,Eminem,Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
39951,Eminem,Almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it
39952,Eminem,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mommas heart
39953,Eminem,And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
39954,Eminem,Mom and Dad was arguing a lot so Momma moved back
39955,Eminem,On to Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
39956,Eminem,And Dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
39957,Eminem,And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
39958,Eminem,And met Dr Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
39959,Eminem,But Daddy had to work you and Momma had to leave me
39960,Eminem,Then you started seein Daddy on the TV and Momma didnt like it
39961,Eminem,And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
39962,Eminem,Papa was a rolling stone Momma developed a habit
39963,Eminem,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
39964,Eminem,Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
39965,Eminem,Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
39966,Eminem,Now Im sittin in this empty house
39967,Eminem,Just reminiscin lookin at your baby pictures it just trips me out

40001,Eminem,In order for me to pick the mic back up
40002,Eminem,I dont know how or why or when
40003,Eminem,I ended up in this position Im in
40004,Eminem,Im starting to feel distant again
40005,Eminem,So I decided just to pick this pen
40006,Eminem,Up and try to make an attempt to vent
40007,Eminem,But I just cant admit or come to grips with the fact
40008,Eminem,That I may be done with rap I need a new outlet
40009,Eminem,And I know some shits so hard to swallow
40010,Eminem,But I just cant sit back and wallow
40011,Eminem,In my own sorrow but I know one fact 
40012,Eminem,Ill be one tough act to follow one tough act to follow
40013,Eminem,Ill be one tough act to follow

40028,Eminem,Of the room just as soon as
40029,Eminem,I walk in its like all eyes on me
40030,Eminem,So I try to avoid any eye contact

40033,Eminem,Im not lookin for extra attention
40034,Eminem,I just wanna be just like you
40035,Eminem,Blend in with the rest of the room

40064,Eminem,I was never the type of kid
40065,Eminem,To wait by the door and pack his bags
40066,Eminem,And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
40067,Eminem,For a dad to show up who never did
40068,Eminem,I just wanted to fit in in every single place
40069,Eminem,Every school I went I dreamed of being that cool kid

40071,Eminem, Keep making that face itll get stuck like that  
40072,Eminem,Meanwhile Im just standin there
40073,Eminem,Holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this
40074,Eminem,Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole

40077,Eminem,But I already told you my whole life story

40109,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired Am I a martian 
40110,Eminem,What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in 
40111,Eminem, Cause I dont belong in this world

40113,Eminem,Flyin off at the handle at my mom
40114,Eminem,No dad so I am noncompliant at home
40115,Eminem,At school Im just shy and awkward
40116,Eminem,And I dont need no goddamn psychologist
40117,Eminem,Tryin to diagnose why I have all these underlyin problems
40118,Eminem,Thinkin he can try and solve em
40119,Eminem,Im outside chalkin up drawings
40120,Eminem,On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin
40121,Eminem,To myself either that or inside hidin off in
40122,Eminem,The corner somewhere quiet tryin not to
40123,Eminem,Be noticed  cause Im cryin and sobbin
40124,Eminem,I had a bad day at school so I aint talkin
40125,Eminem,Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker
40126,Eminem, Cause he said that I eye balled him
40127,Eminem,And if you fall Ill catch you there

40133,Eminem,Its not up to me we can only see
40134,Eminem,This is my legacy legacy legacy legacy
40135,Eminem,I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
40136,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
40137,Eminem, Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind bogglin
40138,Eminem, Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit
40139,Eminem,Bothers me but not my father he said sayonara
40140,Eminem,Then split but I don t give a shit
40141,Eminem,Im fine long as theres batteries in my Walkman
40142,Eminem,Nothing is the matter with me
40143,Eminem,Shit look on the bright side at least I aint walkin
40144,Eminem,I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
40145,Eminem,Complex on a ten speed which Ive acquired parts that
40146,Eminem,I find in the garbage a frame then put tires on it
40147,Eminem,Headphones on look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
40148,Eminem,But if this is all there is for me life offers
40149,Eminem,Why bother even tryin to put up a fight Its nonsense
40150,Eminem,But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
40151,Eminem,What about them rhymes Ive been jottin 
40152,Eminem,They are kind of giving me confidence
40153,Eminem,Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
40154,Eminem,Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx 
40155,Eminem,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
40156,Eminem,Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eye balled him
40157,Eminem,Grab hold of my balls like  Thats right fights on bitch  
40158,Eminem,Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that

40165,Eminem,I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
40166,Eminem,Now I think the fact that Im differently wireds awesome
40167,Eminem, Cause if I wasnt I wouldnt be able to work words like this
40168,Eminem,And connect lines like crosswords
40169,Eminem,And use my enemys words as strength

40253,Eminem,So I could come back a brand new me
40254,Eminem,And dont even realize what you did believe me you
40255,Eminem,Ive been through the wringer

40262,Eminem,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
40265,Eminem,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
40266,Eminem,Id shoot for the moon but Im too busy gazin at stars
40267,Eminem,I m not afraid  I m not afraid

40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear

40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand

40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then

40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin

41252,Eminem,All we see is em beat charges
41253,Eminem,We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
41254,Eminem,So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings

41257,Eminem,If you try to slander the flag but
41258,Eminem,Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb

41858,Eminem,And you arent really surprised at that
41859,Eminem,But as far as these lines I rap
41860,Eminem,And these bars wouldnt dial it back if I star   ed the track
41861,Eminem, Whats your name  Marshall
41862,Eminem, Whos your daddy  I dont have one
41863,Eminem,My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
41864,Eminem,And had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in
41865,Eminem,The side of loco motive with rap Im
41866,Eminem,Loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
41867,Eminem,Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
41868,Eminem,Bout to explode all over the canvas
41869,Eminem,Back with the Yoda of rap  In a spasm
41870,Eminem,But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasnt
41871,Eminem,Follow you must Rick Rubin my little Padawan  
41872,Eminem,A Jedi in training colossal brain and
41873,Eminem,But docile and impossible to explain and Im also vain and
41874,Eminem,Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
41875,Eminem,Puke Skywalker but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
41876,Eminem,Full of such blind rage I need a seein eye dog
41877,Eminem,Cant even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
41878,Eminem,Couldnt see what I wrote I write small
41879,Eminem,It says  Ever since I drove a   Lincoln with whitewalls
41880,Eminem,And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard  
41881,Eminem,So as long as Im on the clock punching this time card
41882,Eminem,Hip hop aint dying on my watch
41883,Eminem,Now sometimes when Im sleepin
41884,Eminem,She comes to me in my dreams
41885,Eminem,Dont got time dont care dont have two shits to give
41886,Eminem,Let me take you by the hand to promised land
41887,Eminem,Cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing
41888,Eminem, Now whats your name  Marshall
41889,Eminem, Whos your daddy  I don t know him but I wonder
41890,Eminem, Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live  
41891,Eminem,He wouldnt have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
41892,Eminem,I wouldnt be so mad my attitude wouldnt be so bad
41893,Eminem,Yeah Dad Im the epitome and the prime
41894,Eminem,Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
41895,Eminem,Falls into the wrong hands and
41896,Eminem,Makes you want to get up and start dancin
41897,Eminem,Even if it is Charles Manson
41898,Eminem,Who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin
41899,Eminem,Laughin all the way to the bank lampin in my K Mart mansion
41900,Eminem,I m in the style department
41901,Eminem,With a pile in my cart rippin the aisle apart but
41902,Eminem,Absolutely no responsibility for content
41903,Eminem,Completely despondent and condescending
41904,Eminem,The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
41905,Eminem,Beat killing spree Your Honor
41906,Eminem,I must plead guilty cause I sparked a revolution
41907,Eminem,Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
41908,Eminem,Of rap to take it to the next level boost it
41909,Eminem,But several rebuked it and whoever produced it
41910,Eminem,  Hip hop is the Devils music  
41911,Eminem,Does that mean it belongs to me 
41912,Eminem,Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
41913,Eminem,That dont honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
41914,Eminem,But lyrically I never hear a peep not even a whisper
41915,Eminem,Rappers better stay clear of me bitch cause its the 
41916,Eminem,Its the time of the season
41917,Eminem,And this time I wont give it to you easy
41918,Eminem,When I take back whats mine
41919,Eminem,And torture everyone that is my plan
41920,Eminem,Cause theres no rhyme or no reason for nothing
41921,Eminem, Whos your daddy  I don t give a fuck but I wonder
41922,Eminem, Is he rich like me  Doubt it ha
41923,Eminem, Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live  
41924,Eminem,Lets have us a father and son talk
41925,Eminem,But I bet we wouldnt probably get one block
41926,Eminem,Without me knocking your block off this is all your fault
41927,Eminem,Maybe thats why Im so bananas I a ppealed to all those walks
41928,Eminem,Of life whoever had strife
41929,Eminem,Maybe thats what dad and son talks are like
41930,Eminem,Cause I related to the struggles of young America
41931,Eminem,When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
41932,Eminem,Now theyre rippin out their fuckin hair again its hysterical
41933,Eminem,I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
41934,Eminem,Yeah uh oh better beware knuckle heads 
41935,Eminem,The sign of my hustle says 
41936,Eminem, Dont knock the doors broken it wont lock
41937,Eminem,It might just fly open get cold cocked
41938,Eminem,You critics come to pay me a visit 
41939,Eminem,Misery loves company please stay a minute  
41940,Eminem,Zip your lip if you dish it but cant take it
41941,Eminem,Too busy gettin stoned in your glass house
41942,Eminem,To kick rocks then you wonder why I lash out
41943,Eminem,Mr Mathers as advertised on the flyers so spread the word
41944,Eminem,Cause Im promoting my passion until Im passed out
41945,Eminem,Completely brain dead Rain Man
41946,Eminem,Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
41947,Eminem,So bitch shoot me a look it better be a blank stare

41950,Eminem,Put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fuckin thang yeah
41951,Eminem,And quit tryin look for a fuckin reason for it that aint there
41952,Eminem,But I still am a  Criminal

41954,Eminem,The last Mathers LP done went diamond
41955,Eminem,This time Im predicting this one will go emerald 
41956,Eminem,When will the madness end 
41957,Eminem,How can it when theres no method to the pad and pen 
41958,Eminem,The only message that I have to send
41959,Eminem,Is  Dad Im back at it again  
41960,Eminem,Today is a painful reminder
41961,Eminem,Of why we can only get brighter

41976,Eminem,With the thorn bush that you used to smell the roses
41977,Eminem,Stopped to inhale cant even tell your nose is
41978,Eminem,Stuffed so focused on the bright side
41979,Eminem,Then you floor the gas pedal

55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib

55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only

55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro

56319,J Cole,Justifying that half ass shit he dropped we always buy it
56320,J Cole,When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
56321,J Cole,Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
56323,J Cole,Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
56324,J Cole,Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
56325,J Cole,The type of nigga swear he real but all around hims fake
56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him

56329,J Cole,Into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
56330,J Cole,Maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas

56352,J Cole,I write whats in my heart dont give a fuck who fuckin with it
56353,J Cole,But in a sense I can relate the need to be great
56354,J Cole,Turns into an obsession and keeps a nigga up late
56355,J Cole,Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me 
56359,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
56360,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this be like this

56364,J Cole,They talk about being a man so much
56365,J Cole,I finally understand that they aint even sure
56366,J Cole,Bout who they are and why they do this
56367,J Cole,Guess Im included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory
56368,J Cole,My highest moments come from tellin all the saddest stories
56369,J Cole,Ive seen in my life I be fiendin to write
56370,J Cole,Songs that raise the hair on my arms
56371,J Cole,My lowest moments came from tryin too hard
56372,J Cole,To impress some niggas that couldnt care if Im on
56373,J Cole,Therefore from here on out my hair grow out
56374,J Cole,I care nothin bout opinions
