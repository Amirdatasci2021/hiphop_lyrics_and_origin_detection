55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib

55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass

55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled

56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me 
56359,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this
56360,J Cole,Somebody shoulda told me it would be like this be like this
56361,J Cole,False prophets  La la la la la la la la la

114587,Talib Kweli,Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
114588,Talib Kweli,If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth 
114589,Talib Kweli,Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
114590,Talib Kweli,If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
114591,Talib Kweli,Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
114592,Talib Kweli,If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
114593,Talib Kweli,Naturally thats confusion to a youngn tryna follow Christ
114594,Talib Kweli,Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
114595,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was Jewish not a Christian
114596,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was law according to politicians
114597,Talib Kweli,Who was King James And why did he think it was so vital
114598,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible 
114599,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground and Heaven is in the sky
114600,Talib Kweli,And they say thats where you go when you die
114601,Talib Kweli,It s bad here on Earth but if we don t get to heaven
114602,Talib Kweli,It s hell  its all going to 
114603,Talib Kweli,Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
114604,Talib Kweli,Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
114605,Talib Kweli,I used to study my lessons it was a blessing not a curse
114606,Talib Kweli,I learned that Heaven and Hell exist right here on Earth word
114607,Talib Kweli,Studied with Rastafarians and learned from the dreads that hell
114608,Talib Kweli,Is called Babylon and thats where them crazy baldheads dwell
114609,Talib Kweli,They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
114610,Talib Kweli,But real Muslims believe in paradise and the resist the Shaitan
114611,Talib Kweli,So it all sound the same to me
114612,Talib Kweli,Thats why when they say one is right and the other is wrong
114613,Talib Kweli,It just sound like game to me
114614,Talib Kweli,Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
114615,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
114616,Talib Kweli,The difference between those who claim to be
114617,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual
114618,Talib Kweli,And recognizing that life is full of miracles
114619,Talib Kweli,You could see my glow in a rhyme
114620,Talib Kweli,The poem divine cause it coincide with a grow in the time
114621,Talib Kweli,That those who looking for God knowin to go inside
114622,Talib Kweli,It s bad here on Earth but if we don t get to heaven
114623,Talib Kweli,It s hell  its all going to 
114624,Talib Kweli,Living in mass confusion looking for absolution
114625,Talib Kweli,The gas seducin and psychopath produce the last solution
114626,Talib Kweli,Based on his interpretation of what the words were saying
114627,Talib Kweli,Trying to get to God but ended up doing the work of Satan
114628,Talib Kweli,Religion create division make the Muslim hate the Christian
114629,Talib Kweli,Make the Christian hate the Jew make the rules of faith
114630,Talib Kweli,That you condition to and to you gotta follow
114631,Talib Kweli,And God forbid you go to Hell
114632,Talib Kweli,But if you ever walked through any ghetto then you know it well
114633,Talib Kweli,Momma say its her after me
114634,Talib Kweli,Preacher say its blasphemy

116415,Talib Kweli,Tried to start a union but they blocked me like a Soviet
116416,Talib Kweli,I hope they get it Im sick of explaining history
116417,Talib Kweli,Im rolling with a circle of winners we claimin victories
116418,Talib Kweli,It aint a mystery the hatell make it bittersweet

116431,Talib Kweli,Just stay bright so shine your light 
116432,Talib Kweli,Were in a transitional world right now because the nature of distribution is changing The distribution channels that people have built over the last century or so are in flux The print the visual artist the musicians   which on the one hand intimidating and on the other immensely liberating The rules the assumptions the now were supposed tos  of how you get your work seen and what you do then theyre breaking down The gatekeepers are leaving their gates You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen The old rules are crumbling And nobody knows what the new rules are so make up your own rules
116433,Talib Kweli,Peace peace everything we do is a creation
116434,Talib Kweli,In complete harmony our creation becomes art
116435,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented stems from the human imagination
116436,Talib Kweli,Everything weve ever invented or created
116437,Talib Kweli,That moved an era is recognized as work of genius
116438,Talib Kweli,Science and the empirical man philosophy and the thinker
116439,Talib Kweli,Religion and the shaman art and the sick who can metabolize
116440,Talib Kweli,Everything with a trace of decay is human error
116441,Talib Kweli,Forgivable human error the curse
116442,Talib Kweli,From the radiance of the gift which becomes shadow
116443,Talib Kweli,Necessary evil so to speak or wed have figured it out by now
116444,Talib Kweli,Striving for perfection is a result of genius
116445,Talib Kweli,Find peace share your genius
116446,Talib Kweli,See I cant see my own face without a reflection
116447,Talib Kweli,Whether it be your reaction to my expression a mirror or water
116448,Talib Kweli,I need the outside to know the inside which is where I reside
116449,Talib Kweli,Through this understanding I know that all things are one
116450,Talib Kweli,According to science everything is a wave of energy
116451,Talib Kweli,A soundwave reaches my ear and my mind makes something of it
116452,Talib Kweli,My eyes are receptors for another type of energy
116453,Talib Kweli,Which my mind then depicts as images same goes for smell and touch
116454,Talib Kweli,Time and space are tools which help me concretize these waves into information
116455,Talib Kweli,Now when given full attention to something other than time and space
116456,Talib Kweli,Time and space disappear Im simply doing
116457,Talib Kweli,Yesterday tomorrow here there poof 
116458,Talib Kweli,It is always now all is energy
116459,Talib Kweli,Even thoughts are forms of energy waves floating
116460,Talib Kweli,Technically Im only a vessel channeling those thoughts
116461,Talib Kweli,My mind chooses to tune into these frequencies
116462,Talib Kweli,Which I either contemplate or share with the outside
116463,Talib Kweli,I believe we all function with the same foundation
116464,Talib Kweli,Energy which is everything
116465,Talib Kweli,Everything is one big ocean of energy
116466,Talib Kweli,Everything is within you everything is you
116467,Talib Kweli,The identity of me is but a series of memories
116468,Talib Kweli,In which my mind decides to narrate in order to create that feeling
116469,Talib Kweli,The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved
116470,Talib Kweli,In other words energy can neither be created or destroyed
116471,Talib Kweli,We are thus forever and death is but a blink
116472,Talib Kweli,So I ask why hurt Why kill Why hate Why fear Why war 
116473,Talib Kweli,Why the feelings of uneasiness if all is but a single form of energy entertaining itself 
116474,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116475,Talib Kweli,Can the state of the world change 
116476,Talib Kweli,If energy only seems to transform then why not 
116477,Talib Kweli,It seems as if darkness has always reigned over
116478,Talib Kweli,We live on a planet amongst the system in a dark space
116479,Talib Kweli,A planet amongst other planets routing around the sun
116480,Talib Kweli,In the same fashion as electrons do
116481,Talib Kweli,Around the nucleus which form the cells which form us
116482,Talib Kweli,Ah yes all is one and my friends it is beautiful
116483,Talib Kweli,Let us unify our heart now feel your power and I thank you
116484,Talib Kweli,Snap ya fingers do ya step
116485,Talib Kweli,The era of the musical beautiful mistakes
116486,Talib Kweli,Delivered hand to hand like we slangin the mixtapes
116487,Talib Kweli,You tryin to describe us you might as well get it straight
116488,Talib Kweli,We the content creators we greater than clickbait
116489,Talib Kweli,The passion for the culture the vultures they try to kill it
116490,Talib Kweli,Its a war for your spirit the lyrics is here to heal us
116491,Talib Kweli,We looking for the fountain to keep us forever young
116492,Talib Kweli,While I get my energy from the sun all things are one
116493,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116494,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongue
116495,Talib Kweli,My color is my penalty mentally on the run
116496,Talib Kweli,Photosynthesizing my energy from the sun huh
116497,Talib Kweli,Releasing blockages I aint stoppin until they gone
116498,Talib Kweli,Feeling weighted down like my pockets is full of stone
116499,Talib Kweli,Until I realized I can change whats going on  lets go  
116500,Talib Kweli,To every single place I go Im right at home
116501,Talib Kweli,Im right at home  lets go  
116502,Talib Kweli,Waiting for that day to come huh
116503,Talib Kweli,Looking for fountains to keep us forever young
116504,Talib Kweli,Get my energy from the sun
116505,Talib Kweli,Rollin the blunt on a copy of Native Sun
116506,Talib Kweli,Gettin hung just for speakin the native tongues
116507,Talib Kweli,Every Sunday waking up catching gossip at its worst
116508,Talib Kweli,Couldnt see the difference in the Baptist and the Catholic Church
116509,Talib Kweli,Caught up in the rapture of the first chapter and second verse
116510,Talib Kweli,If we all Gods children then whats the word of the reverend worth 
116511,Talib Kweli,Taught early that faith is blind like justice when you facing time
116512,Talib Kweli,If we all made in Gods image then that means his face is mine
116513,Talib Kweli,Wait or its that blasphemy its logical it has to be
116514,Talib Kweli,If I dont look like my father then the way I live is bastardly
116515,Talib Kweli,Naturally thats confusion to a youngn trying to follow Christ
116516,Talib Kweli,Taught that if you dont know Jesus then you lead a hollow life
116517,Talib Kweli,Never question the fact that Jesus was a Jew and not a Christian
116518,Talib Kweli,Or that Christianity was made law by politicians
116519,Talib Kweli,And who was King James And why did he think that it was so vital
116520,Talib Kweli,To remove chapters and make his own version of the Bible
116521,Talib Kweli,They say Hell is underground Heaven is in the sky
116522,Talib Kweli,They say thats where you go when you die but how they know 
116523,Talib Kweli,Ive been to many churches Ive quoted many verses
116524,Talib Kweli,Ive dealt with my base self I controlled my many urges
116525,Talib Kweli,I used to study my lessons that was a blessing not a curse
116526,Talib Kweli,I found out that heaven and hell exist right here on earth word
116527,Talib Kweli,Studied with Rastafarians found out from the dreads that hell
116528,Talib Kweli,Is called Babylon and thats where the crazy boarheads dwell
116529,Talib Kweli,They got us thinking that Muslims like to make bombs
116530,Talib Kweli,But real muslims believe in paradise and resisting Shaitan
116531,Talib Kweli,So it all sound the same to me
116532,Talib Kweli,But when they say ones right and the other is wrong
116533,Talib Kweli,It just sound like game to me
116534,Talib Kweli,Its like God skipped past the church and came to me
116535,Talib Kweli,Its just a particular way that I came to see
116536,Talib Kweli,The difference between those that claim to be
116537,Talib Kweli,Religious and those that say they spiritual
116538,Talib Kweli,And recognize that life is full of miracles
116539,Talib Kweli,You can see the flow is divine
116540,Talib Kweli,Cause it coincide with a growing tide
116541,Talib Kweli,Of those looking for God that know to go inside
116542,Talib Kweli,The gas inducing psychopath created a last solution
116543,Talib Kweli,Based on his interpretation
116544,Talib Kweli,Of what the words are saying
116545,Talib Kweli,Looking for God but ended up doing the work of satan
116546,Talib Kweli,Make the Muslim hate the Christian
116547,Talib Kweli,Make the Christian hate the Jew
116548,Talib Kweli,That you condition to and gotta follow
116549,Talib Kweli,But if you ever been to any ghetto then you know it well
116550,Talib Kweli,Lighten it up brighten it up yea
116551,Talib Kweli,You want the grown step your bars up
116552,Talib Kweli,You brag about the scrilla them killas lighten your cars up
116553,Talib Kweli,Welcome to the complete history of the one known as Talib Kweli
116554,Talib Kweli,Such a blessing Im making the bread leven
116555,Talib Kweli,Descendant of Terra Firma Im from the era of legend
116556,Talib Kweli,The blind to my eyesight too scared of the world ending
116557,Talib Kweli,My men of spiritual essence be walking right into heaven
116558,Talib Kweli,Ascending without the stairs expressing without the fears
116559,Talib Kweli,We diamonds but our minds are corrupted just like De Beers
116560,Talib Kweli,Unravelling minds travelling through time like langoliers
116561,Talib Kweli,Standing with the flow like the man in the gondolier
116562,Talib Kweli,In the park of Washington Square locks in my hair
116563,Talib Kweli,Louder than the bull horns we was locking em there
116564,Talib Kweli,Cops would prepare to lock us up
116565,Talib Kweli,They was scared like tales from the dark side
116566,Talib Kweli,Summer of the Central Park five
116567,Talib Kweli,    was the number the year that I started rhyming
116568,Talib Kweli,From Brooklyn to Staten Island them Decepticons was wildin
116569,Talib Kweli,Music soothing but the imagery violent as bomb threats
116570,Talib Kweli,Therapy for the prison industrial complex
116571,Talib Kweli,Provided the context for the crime with the TEC  
116572,Talib Kweli,At Brooklyn Tech I spit it the best so they had to respect mine
116573,Talib Kweli,I did it to death on my grind on a quest to get signed
116574,Talib Kweli,Sorta like the tribe would always suggest we check the rhyme
116575,Talib Kweli,An internal with Puff Daddy in front of the buffed patio
116576,Talib Kweli,Rolling with Hi Tek in the MPV through the streets of the Nati
116577,Talib Kweli,Before graduating to Caddies was carrying crates
116578,Talib Kweli,Shoutout to Flex all day doing records with John Forte
116579,Talib Kweli,We was standing outside the tower devouring prey
116580,Talib Kweli,Powerful display of bullet points that we shower and spray the block with
116581,Talib Kweli,Back in them salad days these rappers was appetizers
116582,Talib Kweli,I played it like I was David I was tackling that Goliath
116583,Talib Kweli,Attacking the open mics to the victory was decisive
116584,Talib Kweli,This life it was so enticing my surgery so precise
116585,Talib Kweli,I would chop it like thin slices at parties we politic
116586,Talib Kweli,At the country club lighting up dutches with Pac and Big
116587,Talib Kweli,At the crib of supernatural battling back and forth
116588,Talib Kweli,Back before Jean was in the unsigned hype in the back of The Source
116589,Talib Kweli,Rest in peace to Allahs sons Shabba was liking to call you son
116590,Talib Kweli,Cause you mine I call you son cause you shine
