39514,Eminem,It goes Reggie JayZ  Pac and Biggie
39515,Eminem,Andr from OutKast Jada Kurupt Nas and then me

39538,Eminem,My thoughts are sporadic I act like Im an addict
39539,Eminem,I rap like Im addicted to smack like Im Kim Mathers
39540,Eminem,But I dont wanna go forth and back in constant battles

39948,Eminem,Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
39949,Eminem,And your mom was saving money for you in a jar

39955,Eminem,On to Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment
39956,Eminem,And Dad moved back to the other side of  Mile on Novara
39957,Eminem,And thats when Daddy went to California with his CD
39958,Eminem,And met Dr Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
39959,Eminem,But Daddy had to work you and Momma had to leave me
39960,Eminem,Then you started seein Daddy on the TV and Momma didnt like it
39961,Eminem,And you and Lainie were too young to understand it

39963,Eminem,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
39964,Eminem,Im just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand

40004,Eminem,Im starting to feel distant again
40005,Eminem,So I decided just to pick this pen
40006,Eminem,Up and try to make an attempt to vent
40007,Eminem,But I just cant admit or come to grips with the fact
40008,Eminem,That I may be done with rap I need a new outlet
40009,Eminem,And I know some shits so hard to swallow
40010,Eminem,But I just cant sit back and wallow

40119,Eminem,Im outside chalkin up drawings
40120,Eminem,On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin

40135,Eminem,I used to be the type of kid that would always think the skys fallin
40136,Eminem,Why am I so differently wired in my noggin 
40137,Eminem, Cause sporadic as my thoughts come its mind bogglin
40138,Eminem, Cause I obsess on everything in my mind small shit

40151,Eminem,What about them rhymes Ive been jottin 
40152,Eminem,They are kind of giving me confidence
40153,Eminem,Instead of tryin to escape through my comics
40154,Eminem,Why dont I just blast a little something like Onyx 
40155,Eminem,To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
40156,Eminem,Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eye balled him

40251,Eminem,It was my decision to get clean I did it for me
40252,Eminem,Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
40253,Eminem,So I could come back a brand new me
40254,Eminem,And dont even realize what you did believe me you
40255,Eminem,Ive been through the wringer
40256,Eminem,But they can do little to the middle finger
40257,Eminem,I think I got a tear in my eye I feel like the king of
40258,Eminem,My world haters can make like bees with no stingers
40259,Eminem,And drop dead no more beef lingers
40260,Eminem,No more drama from now on I promise
40261,Eminem,To focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father
40262,Eminem,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
40263,Eminem,And raise it you couldnt lift a single shingle on it
40264,Eminem, Cause the way I feel Im strong enough to go to the club
40265,Eminem,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
40266,Eminem,Id shoot for the moon but Im too busy gazin at stars

40273,Eminem,Holla if you feel like you ve been down the same road
40274,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40275,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40276,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40277,Eminem,Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
40278,Eminem,Find different ways to word the same old song
40279,Eminem,From the day the song called  Hi My Name Is dropped
40280,Eminem,Started thinking my name was Fault
40281,Eminem, Cause any time things went wrong
40282,Eminem,I was the one who they would blame it on
40283,Eminem,The media made me the equivalent
40284,Eminem,Of a modern day Genghis Khan
40285,Eminem,Tried to argue it was only entertainment dog
40286,Eminem,Gangster Nah courageous balls
40287,Eminem,Had to change my style they said Im way too soft
40288,Eminem,And I sound like AZ and Nas out came the claws
40289,Eminem,And the fangs been out since then
40290,Eminem,But up until the instant that I went against it
40291,Eminem,That I wouldnt amount to a shitstain I thought
40292,Eminem,No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
40293,Eminem, Do I really belong in this game   I pondered
40294,Eminem,Should I make waves or not 
40295,Eminem,So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
40296,Eminem,And I dont wanna seem ungrateful
40297,Eminem,Or disrespect the artform I was raised upon
40298,Eminem,But sometimes you gotta take a loss
40299,Eminem,And have people rub it in your face
40300,Eminem,Before you get made pissed off
40301,Eminem,And keep plugging its your only outlet
40302,Eminem,And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it
40303,Eminem,Better find a way to counter it quick and make it ah
40304,Eminem,Feel like Ive already said this a kabillion eighty times
40305,Eminem,How many times can I say the same thing
40306,Eminem,Different ways that rhyme 
40307,Eminem,What I really wanna say is if theres anyone else that can relate to my story bet you feel the same way I felt
40308,Eminem,When I was in the same place you are when I was afraid to 
40309,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40310,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40311,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40312,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40313,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40314,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40315,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40316,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40317,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40318,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40319,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40320,Eminem,Feels like a close its coming to
40321,Eminem,Its too late to start over
40322,Eminem,This is the only thing I thing I know
40323,Eminem,I know what it was like I was there once
40324,Eminem,Single parents hate your appearance
40325,Eminem,As you struggle to find your place in this world
40326,Eminem,And the pain spawns all the anger on
40327,Eminem,But it wasnt til I put the pain in song
40328,Eminem,Learned who to aim it on that I made a spark
40329,Eminem,Started to spit harder shit
40330,Eminem,Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
40331,Eminem,And there was a lot of bizarre shit but the crazy part
40332,Eminem,Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
40333,Eminem,Haters started to appreciate my art
40334,Eminem,And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
40335,Eminem,But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone
40336,Eminem,And the lights go out in that trailer park
40337,Eminem,And the window is closing and theres nowhere else that I can go with flows and Im frozen
40338,Eminem, Cause theres no more emotion for me to pull from
40339,Eminem,Just a bunch of playful songs that I make for fun
40340,Eminem,So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same old song
40341,Eminem,But I rather make  Not Afraid   
40342,Eminem,Than make another motherfucking  We Made You  ah
40343,Eminem,Now I dont wanna seem indulgent
40344,Eminem,When I discuss my lows and my highs
40345,Eminem,My demise and my uprise pray to God
40346,Eminem,I just open enough eyes later on
40347,Eminem,And gave you the supplies and the tools
40348,Eminem,To hopefully use thatll make you strong
40349,Eminem,Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt
40350,Eminem, Cause I cant explain to yall how dang exhausted my legs felt
40351,Eminem,Just having to balance my dang self
40352,Eminem,When on eggshells I was made to walk
40353,Eminem,But thank you Ma  cause that gave me the
40354,Eminem,Strength to cause Shady mania so when they empty that stadium
40355,Eminem,Least I made it out of that house
40356,Eminem,And found a place in this world when the day was done
40357,Eminem,So this is for every kid who alls they ever did
40358,Eminem,Was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
40359,Eminem,I represent him or her anyone similar
40360,Eminem,You are the reason that I made this song
40361,Eminem,And everything youre scared to say
40362,Eminem,Dont be afraid to say no more
40363,Eminem,From this day forward just let them a holes talk
40364,Eminem,Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
40365,Eminem,The legend of the angry blonde
40366,Eminem,Lives on through you when I m gone and to think I was a 
40367,Eminem,I was a afraid to make a single sound
40368,Eminem,Afraid I would never find a way out out out
40369,Eminem,I didnt wanna go another round
40370,Eminem,An angry mans power will shut you up
40371,Eminem,Trip wires fill this house with tip toed love
40372,Eminem,Run out of excuses for everyone
40373,Eminem,So here I am and I will not run
40374,Eminem,Guts over fear the time is near
40375,Eminem,Guts over fear I shed a tear
40376,Eminem,For all the times I let you push me round
40377,Eminem,Now I got guts over fear guts over fear
40378,Eminem,Have you ever loved someone so much youd give an arm for 
40379,Eminem,Not the expression no literally give an arm for
40380,Eminem,When they know theyre your heart and you know you were their armor
40381,Eminem,And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
40382,Eminem,But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you

40679,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40680,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40681,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40682,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40683,Eminem,Im supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
40684,Eminem,Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders I aint never supposed to show it
40685,Eminem,My crew aint supposed to know it
40686,Eminem,Even if it means goin toe to toe with a Benzino
40687,Eminem,It dont matter Id never drag them in battles that I can handle
40688,Eminem,Less I absolutely have to Im supposed to set an example
40689,Eminem,I need to be the leader my crew looks for me to guide em
40690,Eminem,If some shit ever does pop off Im supposed to be beside em
40691,Eminem,That Ja shit I tried to squash it it was too late to stop it
40692,Eminem,Theres a certain line you just dont cross and he crossed it
40693,Eminem,I heard him say Hailies name on a song and I just lost it
40694,Eminem,It was crazy the shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit
40695,Eminem,And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
40696,Eminem,I spent so much energy on it honestly Im exhausted
40697,Eminem,And Im so caught in it I almost feel Im the one who caused it
40698,Eminem,This aint what Im in hip hop for its not why I got in it
40699,Eminem,That was never my object for someone to get killed
40700,Eminem,Why would I want to destroy something I helped build 
40701,Eminem,It wasnt my intentions my intentions were good
40702,Eminem,I went through my whole career without ever mentionin     
40703,Eminem,And that was just outta respect for not runnin my mouth
40704,Eminem,And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about
40705,Eminem,Plus Dre told me stay out this just wasnt my beef
40706,Eminem,So I did I just fell back watched and gritted my teeth
40707,Eminem,While hes all over TV down talkin the man
40708,Eminem,Who literally saved my life like fuck it I understand
40709,Eminem,This is business and this shit just isnt none of my business
40710,Eminem,Im still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute  cause 
40711,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart
40712,Eminem,We all fall down like toy soldiers
40713,Eminem,But the battle wages on for toy soldiers
40714,Eminem,There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme and
40715,Eminem,Wouldnt have to worry about one of your people dyin
40716,Eminem,But now its elevated  cause once you put someones kids in it
40717,Eminem,The shit gets escalated  it aint just words no more is it 
40718,Eminem,Its a different ball game you call names and you aint just rappin
40719,Eminem,We actually tried to stop the   and Ja beef from happenin
40720,Eminem,Me and Dre had sat with him kicked it and had a chat with him
40721,Eminem,And asked him not to start it he wasnt gonna go after him
40722,Eminem,Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him
40723,Eminem,Fuck it    smash him Mash him and let him have it 
40724,Eminem,Meanwhile my attentions pulled in another direction
40725,Eminem,Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk
40726,Eminem,Has an erection for me and thinks that Ill be his resurrection
40727,Eminem,Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
40728,Eminem,But now hes fucked the game up
40729,Eminem, Cause one of the ways I came up
40730,Eminem,Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
40731,Eminem,Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin 
40732,Eminem,Well fuck it that motherfucker could get it too fuck him then 
40733,Eminem,But Im so busy bein pissed off I dont stop to think
40734,Eminem,That we just inherited   s beef with Murder Inc 
40735,Eminem,And hes inherited mine which is fine aint like either of us mind
40736,Eminem,We still have soldiers thats on the front line
40737,Eminem,Whos willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders
40738,Eminem,Never to extort us strictly to show they support us
40739,Eminem,And maybe shout em out in a rap or up in the chorus
40740,Eminem,To show em we love em back and let them know how important
40741,Eminem,It is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
40742,Eminem,Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
40743,Eminem,But I aint tryin to have none of my people hurt or murdered
40744,Eminem,It aint worth it I cant think of a perfecter way to word it
40745,Eminem,Than to just say that I love yall too much to see the verdict
40746,Eminem,Ill walk away from it all fore I let it go any further
40747,Eminem,But dont get it twisted its not a plea that Im coppin
40748,Eminem,Im just willing to be the bigger man if yall can quit poppin
40749,Eminem,Off at your jaws well then I can  cause frankly Im sick of talkin
40750,Eminem,Im not goin to let someone elses coffin rest on my conscience
40751,Eminem,Step by step heart to heart

41199,Eminem,I wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
41200,Eminem,I feel like checking out on life cant escape this circumstance
41201,Eminem,Id rather hear em say  Die N word than Die Antwoord
41202,Eminem,Ninja now its better disguised banter
41203,Eminem,But thats life strapped cause were strapped financially
41204,Eminem,Were applying but McDonalds
41205,Eminem,Seems to be the only franchise thatll hire
41206,Eminem,So how can we have higher standards 
41207,Eminem,As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
41208,Eminem,We fight back with violence but acts like that are
41209,Eminem,Black eyes on the movement
41210,Eminem,Which makes black lives madder
41211,Eminem,Thats why its at a stalemate

41222,Eminem,And thats racism the fear that a black face gives em
41223,Eminem,Wait why are there black neighborhoods 
41224,Eminem,Cause America segregated us designated us to an area
41225,Eminem,Separated us Section Eightd us
41226,Eminem,When we tear it up s the only time attention s paid to us
41227,Eminem,And education sucks and every days another

41231,Eminem,But can t escape the sirens
41232,Eminem,Don t take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
41233,Eminem,The poverty that we face so the crime rate s the highest in
41234,Eminem,The lowest classes its like a razor wire fence

41242,Eminem,You peel each others caps for silly stuff like hats 
41243,Eminem,Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
41244,Eminem,While people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
41245,Eminem,Fuck your Republican views
41246,Eminem,Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps where the fuck are the boots 
41247,Eminem,And streets act as a narrator dont gotta read comics
41248,Eminem,Or be that into characters just to see that just to be black
41249,Eminem,You better be strapped with a derringer
41250,Eminem,Or be  capped in America like Steve Rogers
41251,Eminem,Cause no one oversees these cops and
41252,Eminem,All we see is em beat charges
41253,Eminem,We done seen em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
41254,Eminem,So we dont need all you crooked police officers peace offerings
41255,Eminem,Just keep marchin til we reach congress
41256,Eminem,But theyre gonna say youre tryin to take an irrational stance
41257,Eminem,If you try to slander the flag but
41258,Eminem,Somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
41259,Eminem,So they call it a Kaepernick tantrum
41260,Eminem,If you dont stand for the national anthem
41261,Eminem,We raise it you better praise it
41262,Eminem,Or youll be made to feel like a traitor well
41263,Eminem,Treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
41264,Eminem,Home of the brave is still racist ville
41265,Eminem,So this whole nation feels like a plantation field

41807,Eminem,Like you threw it at me encased in plastic
41808,Eminem,And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
41809,Eminem,Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin   
41810,Eminem,Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skins peelin
41811,Eminem,And skids til he hits a cement pillar
41812,Eminem,Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder

41836,Eminem,Thats the plan of attack when Im fixing my problems
41837,Eminem,Wish my chest wasnt having to get these rhymes off em
41838,Eminem,But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
41839,Eminem,And why I havent come back on these faggots who diss me is
41840,Eminem,More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
41841,Eminem,But my patience is wearing thin
41842,Eminem,Swear I been contemplatin rubbing shit in your face til I smear it in
41843,Eminem,Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen

41857,Eminem,Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
41858,Eminem,And you arent really surprised at that
41859,Eminem,But as far as these lines I rap
41860,Eminem,And these bars wouldnt dial it back if I star   ed the track
41861,Eminem, Whats your name  Marshall
41862,Eminem, Whos your daddy  I dont have one

41866,Eminem,Loco its like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
41867,Eminem,Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
41868,Eminem,Bout to explode all over the canvas
41869,Eminem,Back with the Yoda of rap  In a spasm

41875,Eminem,Puke Skywalker but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
41876,Eminem,Full of such blind rage I need a seein eye dog
41877,Eminem,Cant even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
41878,Eminem,Couldnt see what I wrote I write small
41879,Eminem,It says  Ever since I drove a   Lincoln with whitewalls
41880,Eminem,And a dire desire to aspire to Die Hard  
41881,Eminem,So as long as Im on the clock punching this time card
41882,Eminem,Hip hop aint dying on my watch

41897,Eminem,Even if it is Charles Manson
41898,Eminem,Who just happens to be rappin blue lights flashin

41903,Eminem,Completely despondent and condescending
41904,Eminem,The king of nonsense and controversy is on a
41905,Eminem,Beat killing spree Your Honor
41906,Eminem,I must plead guilty cause I sparked a revolution
41907,Eminem,Rebel without a cause who caused the evolution
41908,Eminem,Of rap to take it to the next level boost it
41909,Eminem,But several rebuked it and whoever produced it
41910,Eminem,  Hip hop is the Devils music  
41911,Eminem,Does that mean it belongs to me 
41912,Eminem,Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns

41928,Eminem,Of life whoever had strife
41929,Eminem,Maybe thats what dad and son talks are like

105347,Royce Da 59,Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
105348,Royce Da 59,But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see

105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice

110727,Scarface,And everyday we face to face with death
110728,Scarface,I seen my homies go and come
110729,Scarface,And judgement day is just somethin we cant run from
110730,Scarface,So I know my numbers comin up

110734,Scarface,My brother Quanells tryin to keep the neighbourhood at peace
110735,Scarface,Dont fight each other we gots ta stand and fight the beast
110736,Scarface,So united we stand but we gonna fall quick
110737,Scarface,Because we always tryin to take another brothers shit
110738,Scarface,And the cops is in the same vote
110739,Scarface,Just because we comin up quick they think we slang dope
110740,Scarface,They shootin ta kill they gas aint sparkin goods
110741,Scarface,They shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood
110742,Scarface,And now the storys all twisted up
110743,Scarface,And if they gave the cop the chair
110744,Scarface,I really wouldnt give a fuck
110745,Scarface,Because she left my partners family with memories
110746,Scarface,And after hearin this I know you gon remember me
110747,Scarface,But yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch
110748,Scarface,I see his parents and then I started breakin up
110749,Scarface,Because I know what you did was wrong
110750,Scarface,But you wont realize until you dead and gone
110751,Scarface,It aint no justifiable homicide you never gave a warning
110752,Scarface,You straight up shot him from behind
110753,Scarface,But all the cryin in the world aint gonna bring him back
110754,Scarface,You give a gat to a black he dont know how to act
110755,Scarface,But you gotta tell your story to the judge
110756,Scarface,Not the imitation judge the judge that everybody loves
110757,Scarface,And if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness
110758,Scarface,Then in reality you took care of your business
110759,Scarface,But regardless I know you wanna kill me
110760,Scarface,But I aint goin out like dat
