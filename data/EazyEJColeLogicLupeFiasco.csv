55181,J Cole,It seems my dreams faded for far too long
55182,J Cole,Cant visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
55183,J Cole,Control the block serving up rocks and stay subliminal
55184,J Cole,Cause young niggas is hardheaded they letting off
55185,J Cole,Full of adrenaline ignorant to what death can cause
55186,J Cole,Aint no coming back family dressed in black

55196,J Cole,This is hell and I dont mean that hyperbolic
55197,J Cole,I try to find employment even if its wiping toilets
55198,J Cole,But these felonies be making life the hardest
55199,J Cole,Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
55200,J Cole,Or run up on your yard snatch your daughter bike and pawn it
55201,J Cole,Thats why I write this sonnet
55202,J Cole,If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
55203,J Cole,Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it

55214,J Cole,If you hearing this unfortunately means
55215,J Cole,That Im no longer with you in the physical
55216,J Cole,Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
55217,J Cole,He got me praying that the spiritual is real
55218,J Cole,So I can be a part of you still my pops was killed too
55219,J Cole,So I know how part of you feels
55220,J Cole,Maybe you hate me maybe you miss me maybe you spite me
55221,J Cole,Life goes in cycles maybe youll date a nigga just like me
55222,J Cole,I hope not Im tired of dope spots
55223,J Cole,And fiends that smoke rocks
55224,J Cole,Ive seen far too many niggas hopes rot
55225,J Cole,Im writing this because me and the devil had a dance
55226,J Cole,Now I see death around the corner pologizing in advance
55227,J Cole,Dont know if I ever had a chance
55228,J Cole,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
55229,J Cole,But Daddy had dreams once my eyes had a gleam once
55230,J Cole,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
55231,J Cole,My Pops shot up drug related mama addicted
55232,J Cole,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
55233,J Cole,Blood was staining the concrete
55234,J Cole,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
55235,J Cole,Maintaining a timesheet thats slow money
55236,J Cole,Picked up the family business by the age of thirteen
55237,J Cole,Six years later was handed sentence
55238,J Cole,Round the same time is when you came in this world
55239,J Cole,Me and your mama thinking 
55240,J Cole, What the fuck we naming this girl  
55241,J Cole,I told her  Nina  the prettiest name that I could think of
55242,J Cole,For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen I was nineteen
55243,J Cole,Took me two felonies to see the trap
55244,J Cole,This crooked ass system set for me
55245,J Cole,And now I fear its too late for me to ever be
55246,J Cole,The one that set examples that was never set for me
55247,J Cole,Im living fast but not fast enough
55248,J Cole,Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
55249,J Cole,And if my past becomes the death of me
55250,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55251,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55252,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55253,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55254,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55255,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand me 
55256,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55257,J Cole,Its several ways I couldve went out too many to count
55258,J Cole,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout 
55259,J Cole,Was it the young niggas blasting frustrated
55260,J Cole,Cause the cash running out 
55261,J Cole,Niggas dont know how to act in a drought
55262,J Cole,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
55263,J Cole,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
55264,J Cole,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
55265,J Cole,That real niggas dont speak when they beef with you
55266,J Cole,They just pull up on your street let the heat achoo
55267,J Cole,And if a real nigga hungry he gon eat your food
55268,J Cole,I was a fool spent all my time ducking school ducking cops
55269,J Cole,Ducking rules hugging blocks that dont love you
55270,J Cole,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
55271,J Cole,Much broader than the corner if not its gon corner you
55272,J Cole,Into a box where your son dont even know his pops
55273,J Cole,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
55274,J Cole,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
55275,J Cole,And see your father face while hearing bout tragedy on news
55276,J Cole,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
55277,J Cole,And sadly if youre listening now it must mean its true
55278,J Cole,But maybe theres a chance that its not
55279,J Cole,And this album remains locked
55280,J Cole,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
55281,J Cole,And I can teach you this in person
55282,J Cole,Like Im teaching you to tie your own shoes
55283,J Cole,I love you and I hope to God I dont lose you
55284,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55285,J Cole,For your eyes for your eyes only
55286,J Cole,For your eyes do you understand 
55287,J Cole,One day your daddy called me told me he had a funny feeling
55288,J Cole,What hed been dealing with lately he wasnt telling
55289,J Cole,I tried to pick his brains still he wasnt revealing
55290,J Cole,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
55291,J Cole,And it was chilling he said 
55292,J Cole, Jermaine I knew you since we was children
55293,J Cole,I never asked for nothing when times was hard
55294,J Cole,I never had discussions with you begging you to help me
55295,J Cole,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
55296,J Cole,I know you tried to steer me way from that shit
55297,J Cole,But that shit was in my blood you know my life
55298,J Cole,I know your momma nigga send my love
55299,J Cole,In case I never get a chance to speak again
55300,J Cole,I wont forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib

55302,J Cole,But my granny crib was in the jects 
55303,J Cole, Nigga what you talking bout Fuck is you getting at  
55304,J Cole,He said  Listen I got no time to dive into descriptions
55305,J Cole,But I been having premonitions
55306,J Cole,Just call it visions from the other side
55307,J Cole,I got a feeling I wont see tomorrow
55308,J Cole,Like the time Im living on is borrowed
55309,J Cole,With that said the only thing Im proud to say I was a father
55310,J Cole,Write my story down and if I pass
55311,J Cole,Go play it for my daughter when she ready 
55312,J Cole,And so Im leaving you this record for your eyes only

55314,J Cole,This perspective is a real one another lost Ville son
55315,J Cole,I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
55316,J Cole,Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
55317,J Cole,That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
55318,J Cole,Sometimes I think that segregation wouldve done us better
55319,J Cole,Although I know that means that I would never
55320,J Cole,Be brought into this world cause my daddy was so thrilled
55321,J Cole,When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro

56319,J Cole,Justifying that half ass shit he dropped we always buy it
56320,J Cole,When he tell us he a genius but its clearer lately
56321,J Cole,Its been hard for him to look into the mirror lately
56322,J Cole,There was a time when this nigga was my hero maybe
56323,J Cole,Thats the reason why his fall from grace is hard to take
56324,J Cole,Cause I believed him when he said his shit was purer and he
56325,J Cole,The type of nigga swear he real but all around hims fake
56326,J Cole,The women the dickriders you know the yes men
56327,J Cole,Nobody with the balls to say somethin to contest him
56328,J Cole,So he grows out of control
56329,J Cole,Into the person that he truly was all along its startin to show
56330,J Cole,Maybe its my fault for idolizin niggas
56331,J Cole,Based off the words they be rappin

56355,J Cole,Writin words hopin people observe the dedication
56356,J Cole,That stirs in you constantly but intentions get blurred
56357,J Cole,Do I do it for the love of the music or is there more to me 
56358,J Cole,Do I want these niggas to worship me

57933,J Cole,I got to thinkin about the history of human nature
57934,J Cole,While this instrumental played
57935,J Cole,Then I realized somethin that made
57936,J Cole,Me wonder if revolution was really ever the way
57937,J Cole,Before you trip and throw a fit over these words I say
57938,J Cole,Think about this shit for a second you heard the way
57939,J Cole,The children in abusive households grow up
57940,J Cole,Knockin girlfriends out cold thats called a cycle
57941,J Cole,Abused becomes the abuser and thats just how life go
57942,J Cole,You get the power but you know what power does to man 
57943,J Cole,Corruption always leads us to the same shit again

79892,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79893,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79894,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
79925,Logic,Just like you the person I wrote this for
79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge

80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

81945,Logic,I just contemplate shout out to those who can relate
81946,Logic,And even though it gets hard I know my fate

82090,Lupe Fiasco,Now imagine theres a shorty maybe five maybe four
82091,Lupe Fiasco,Riding round with his mama listening to the radio
82092,Lupe Fiasco,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
82093,Lupe Fiasco,Doesnt know the difference between right and wrong
82094,Lupe Fiasco,Now I aint trying to make it too complex
82095,Lupe Fiasco,But lets just say shorty has an undeveloped context
82096,Lupe Fiasco,About the perception of women these days
82097,Lupe Fiasco,His mama sings along and this what she says
82098,Lupe Fiasco, Niggas Im a bad bitch and Im bad bitch 
82099,Lupe Fiasco,Somethin thats far above average  
82100,Lupe Fiasco,And maybe other rhyming words like  cabbage and  savage 
82101,Lupe Fiasco,And  baby carriage and other things that match it
82102,Lupe Fiasco,Couple of things are happenin here
82103,Lupe Fiasco,First hes relatin the word bitch with his mama  comma
82104,Lupe Fiasco,And because shes relatin to herself
82105,Lupe Fiasco,As most important source of help
82106,Lupe Fiasco,And mental health he may skew respect for dishonor
82107,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82108,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah now imagine a group of little girls nine through twelve
82109,Lupe Fiasco,On the Internet watching videos listening to songs by themselves
82110,Lupe Fiasco,It doesnt really matter if they have parental clearance
82111,Lupe Fiasco,They understand the Internet better than their parents
82112,Lupe Fiasco,Now being the Internet the contents probably uncensored
82113,Lupe Fiasco,Theyre young so theyre malleable and probably unmentored
82114,Lupe Fiasco,A complicated combination maybe with no relevance
82115,Lupe Fiasco,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singers preference
82116,Lupe Fiasco, Bad bitches bad bitches bad bitches
82117,Lupe Fiasco,Thats all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches bad bitches  
82118,Lupe Fiasco,Now lets say that they less concerned with him
82119,Lupe Fiasco,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
82120,Lupe Fiasco,Ah the plot thickens high heels long hair fat booty slim
82121,Lupe Fiasco,Reality check Im not trippin
82122,Lupe Fiasco,They dont see a paid actress just what makes a bad bitch
82123,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82124,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82125,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82126,Lupe Fiasco,Disclaimer this rhymer Lupe is not using  bitch as a lesson
82127,Lupe Fiasco,But as a psychological weapon
82128,Lupe Fiasco,To set in your mind and really mess with your conceptions
82129,Lupe Fiasco,Discretions reflections its clever misdirection
82130,Lupe Fiasco, Cause while I was rappin they was growin up fast
82131,Lupe Fiasco,Nobody stepped in to ever slow em up gasp
82132,Lupe Fiasco,Sho enough in this little world
82133,Lupe Fiasco,The little boy meets one of those little girls
82134,Lupe Fiasco,And he thinks she a bad bitch and she thinks she a bad bitch
82135,Lupe Fiasco,He thinks disrespectfully she thinks of that sexually
82136,Lupe Fiasco,She got the wrong idea he dont wanna fuck her
82137,Lupe Fiasco,He think shes bad at being a bitch like his mother
82138,Lupe Fiasco,Momma never dressed like that
82139,Lupe Fiasco,Come out the house hot mess like that
82140,Lupe Fiasco,Ass titties dressed like that all out to impress like that
82141,Lupe Fiasco,Just like that you see the fruit of the confusion
82142,Lupe Fiasco,He caught in a reality she caught in an illusion
82143,Lupe Fiasco, Bad mean good to her she really nice and smart
82144,Lupe Fiasco,But  bad mean bad to him  bitch dont play a part
82145,Lupe Fiasco,But  bitch still bad to her if you say it the wrong way
82146,Lupe Fiasco,But she think she a bitch  what a double entendre 
82147,Lupe Fiasco,Tell em bitch bad woman good
82148,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82149,Lupe Fiasco,I say I say I say I say I say I say
82150,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82151,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better they misunderstood
82152,Lupe Fiasco,Lady better greatest motherhood
82153,Lupe Fiasco,Were all chemicals vitamins and minerals
82154,Lupe Fiasco,Vicodin with inner tubes wrapped around the arm
82155,Lupe Fiasco,To see the vein like a chicken on the barn
82156,Lupe Fiasco,Top Cat chat lets begin another yarn
82157,Lupe Fiasco,Thats flying saucer cheese or is it chicken parm 
82158,Lupe Fiasco,But roosters dont fly like boosters dont buy
82159,Lupe Fiasco,So what powers cowards to get them to the top
82160,Lupe Fiasco,Just to fall asleep listening to Bach 
82161,Lupe Fiasco,The ribbon in the sky is the riddim that I drop
82162,Lupe Fiasco,Dribbling the eye across the prism of a clock
82163,Lupe Fiasco,That lacks meaning but racks up stacks of fat reading
82164,Lupe Fiasco,They catch Chief and wrapped up plants from trap dealings
82165,Lupe Fiasco,Now whats a coffin with a scratched ceiling 
82166,Lupe Fiasco,And whats the talking without the match feeling
82167,Lupe Fiasco,Thats buried living And cherry picking
82168,Lupe Fiasco,Every lemon from your berry system
82169,Lupe Fiasco,Then proceed with the pack feeding
82170,Lupe Fiasco,When I was young I had visions of another world
82171,Lupe Fiasco,Sneaking looks at the porn stash of my brother Hurl
82172,Lupe Fiasco,Incense smoke made vortices and other curls
82173,Lupe Fiasco,Casting calls from porn films and ad space for rubber girls
82174,Lupe Fiasco,I like my pancakes cut in swirls
82175,Lupe Fiasco,Moroccan moles and undercover squirrels
82176,Lupe Fiasco,I like cartoons southern cities with large moons
82177,Lupe Fiasco,Faith healers ex female drug dealers and art booms
82178,Lupe Fiasco,Apologize for my weird mix
82179,Lupe Fiasco,What taste like hot dogs and tear drips
82180,Lupe Fiasco,And looks like pantomime and clear bricks
82181,Lupe Fiasco,And smells like shotguns and deer piss
82182,Lupe Fiasco,They on their hunt kind of salty that Im going hard
82183,Lupe Fiasco,First part of a party that I throw in parts
82184,Lupe Fiasco,One minute youre playing pool next minute youre throwing darts
82185,Lupe Fiasco,But thats how you do with a party that you throw in bars
82186,Lupe Fiasco,I run the Gambit like Im throwing cards
82187,Lupe Fiasco,From popular mechanics to overdosing hearts
82188,Lupe Fiasco,Paint cold pictures like Nova Scotia landscapes
82189,Lupe Fiasco,Nerd gang make Mandelbrot sets when we handshake
82190,Lupe Fiasco,A word game back up plan that can dam lakes
82191,Lupe Fiasco,Backup the wordplay playing at the mans states
82192,Lupe Fiasco,Means I can still be the man if the dam breaks
82193,Lupe Fiasco,And when demand brakes Im reflectious what they cant face
82194,Lupe Fiasco,My peers will still treat the mirror like its a fan base
82195,Lupe Fiasco,The unfettered veteran the eagle feathered man of medicine
82196,Lupe Fiasco,That hovers above cities like weather men
82197,Lupe Fiasco,Whatever better to tell ya weather comin
82198,Lupe Fiasco,I prefer girls to reign all over the world
82199,Lupe Fiasco,And not rain like rain man or rain like rain dance
82200,Lupe Fiasco,Or rain like a slight chance of rain when its raining
82201,Lupe Fiasco,Or rein like deer slaves to Santa Claus sleigh man
82202,Lupe Fiasco,But reign like Queens that reign over made man
82203,Lupe Fiasco,And not Queen like Queen killer rhapsody bohemian Queen
82204,Lupe Fiasco,But Queen like white glove wave hand and not wave hand like its a heat wave
82205,Lupe Fiasco,So you make a fan by waving your hand Im talking wave like you saying  Hey man  
82206,Lupe Fiasco,And not hay for horses and hoarse is like you almost voiceless
82207,Lupe Fiasco,You gotta treat your vocal chords like its a fortress
82208,Lupe Fiasco,And treat every single one of your words like reinforcements
82209,Lupe Fiasco,And especially when youre recording
82210,Lupe Fiasco,Cause thats the portion thats important
82211,Lupe Fiasco,When I was reporting that I was poor but now Im more than  poor 
82212,Lupe Fiasco,Its still hooker heels on my sugar hills and sweet spots
82213,Lupe Fiasco,Crying shames make margarita rims from cheap tops
82214,Lupe Fiasco,Deep plots in floor to ceiling windows for my peep pots
82215,Lupe Fiasco,A little scene with the sickle swings to make the wheat drop
82216,Lupe Fiasco,And a hundred words for them hummingbirds that like to eavesdrop
82217,Lupe Fiasco,And fan out like peacocks with a parakeet that beat box
82218,Lupe Fiasco,So the sun rise when the beat drops and the sun dies when the beat stops   
82219,Lupe Fiasco,Then it unties then it relocks then it relapsed then it detox
82220,Lupe Fiasco,Then heat back like a heat pack on his knee caps of the weak spot
82221,Lupe Fiasco,Cause he want what we got like yeah
82222,Lupe Fiasco,Then forge poetry like a young ornery Morrissey
82223,Lupe Fiasco,Then spit it to the golden locks thots who like their porridge all watery
82224,Lupe Fiasco,Not scorching nor sorbet y
82225,Lupe Fiasco,From the steel orbitings sorcerer sorcery
82226,Lupe Fiasco,Coming down gorgeously just like a Stacey Dash waterfall
82227,Lupe Fiasco,A more torturing a water boarding Barbie doll
82228,Lupe Fiasco,A river of women like a Brazilian Carnival
82229,Lupe Fiasco,Swimming in feminine bikinis made out of Barbasol
82230,Lupe Fiasco,Somebody give them the volleyballs
82231,Lupe Fiasco,If you love her dont ever send her to Mally Malls
82232,Lupe Fiasco,Homie if she lonely she might end up in Macaulys claws

84403,Lupe Fiasco,Torture terror fear til they nearly disappear
84404,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84405,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84406,Lupe Fiasco,Ways and means from the trade of human beings
84407,Lupe Fiasco,A slave labor force provides wealth to the machine
84408,Lupe Fiasco,And helps the new regime establish and expand

84420,Lupe Fiasco,Foolishness and flaws greed and needs and disagreement
84421,Lupe Fiasco,And then you rush to have the most from the day you left your boats
84422,Lupe Fiasco,Youll starve but never die in a world of hungry ghosts
84423,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84424,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84425,Lupe Fiasco,As archaeologists dig in the deserts of the east
84426,Lupe Fiasco,A pit a hundred meters wide and a hundred meters deep
84427,Lupe Fiasco,They discover ancient cars on even older streets
84428,Lupe Fiasco,And a city well preserved and most likely at its peak
84429,Lupe Fiasco,A culture so advanced and by condition of the teeth
84430,Lupe Fiasco,They can tell that they were civil not barbaric in the least
84431,Lupe Fiasco,A society at peace With liberty and justice for all
84432,Lupe Fiasco,Neatly carved in what seems to be a wall
84433,Lupe Fiasco,They would doubt that there was any starvation at all
84434,Lupe Fiasco,That they pretty much had the poverty problem all solved
84435,Lupe Fiasco,From the sheer amount of paper most likely used for trade
84436,Lupe Fiasco,Everythings so organized They had to be well behaved
84437,Lupe Fiasco,Assumed they had clean energy little to no enemies
84438,Lupe Fiasco,Very honest leaders with overwhelming sympathies
84439,Lupe Fiasco,Religions kinda complex Kinda hard to figure out
84440,Lupe Fiasco,But this must be the temple
84441,Lupe Fiasco,This world my heart my soul
84442,Lupe Fiasco,But tears they soak on through
84443,Lupe Fiasco,In the same suit that he was buried in
84444,Lupe Fiasco,Similar to the one his grandfather was married in
84445,Lupe Fiasco,Yes he was still fresh to death
84446,Lupe Fiasco,Bling two earrings a chain layin on his chest
84447,Lupe Fiasco,He still had it cause they couldnt find it
84448,Lupe Fiasco,And the bullets from his enemies
84449,Lupe Fiasco,Sat like two inches behind it
84450,Lupe Fiasco,From when his niggas got reminded
84451,Lupe Fiasco,And poured out liquor in his memory
84452,Lupe Fiasco,But he couldnt sip it fast enough
84453,Lupe Fiasco,So the liquor was just fillin the casket up
84454,Lupe Fiasco,Floatin down by his feet was the letter from his sister
84455,Lupe Fiasco,Second grade handwriting simply read  I miss ya 
84456,Lupe Fiasco,Suit jacket pocket held his baby daughters picture
84457,Lupe Fiasco,Right next to it one of his mans stuck a Swisher
84458,Lupe Fiasco,He saw that the latch was broken
84459,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84460,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84461,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84462,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84463,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84464,Lupe Fiasco,Tarnished gold chain is what he loosened up the earth with
84465,Lupe Fiasco,He used his mouth as a shovel to try and hollow it
84466,Lupe Fiasco,And when he couldnt dirt spit he swallowed it
84467,Lupe Fiasco,Working like a hmm reverse archaeologist
84468,Lupe Fiasco,Except his buried treasure was sunshine
84469,Lupe Fiasco,Through a hole that he had drove
84470,Lupe Fiasco,He grabbed onto some grass and climbed
84471,Lupe Fiasco,Pulled himself up out of his own grave
84472,Lupe Fiasco,On the watch that had stopped
84473,Lupe Fiasco,Six months after the shots
84474,Lupe Fiasco,Wringing Henny out his socks
84475,Lupe Fiasco,To brush the dirt up off his shoulder
84476,Lupe Fiasco,So with a right hand that was all bones
84477,Lupe Fiasco,And no reason to stay he decided to walk home
84478,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84479,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84480,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84481,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84482,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84483,Lupe Fiasco,Caught the reflection in the window
84484,Lupe Fiasco,Matter of fact only thing on his brain was brains
84485,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah and gettin back in his lane
84486,Lupe Fiasco,First he had to find something to slang
84487,Lupe Fiasco,Walked right past the same spot
84488,Lupe Fiasco,That some lil niggas tried to sell him rocks
84489,Lupe Fiasco,It just felt weird being on the opposite
84490,Lupe Fiasco,They figured that he wasnt from there
84491,Lupe Fiasco,So they pulled out and robbed him
84492,Lupe Fiasco,With the same gun they shot him with
84493,Lupe Fiasco,Put it to his head and said
84494,Lupe Fiasco,This life goes passing you by
84495,Lupe Fiasco,It might go fast if you lie
84496,Lupe Fiasco,You born you live then you die
84497,Lupe Fiasco,If life goes passing you by
84498,Lupe Fiasco,If youre breaking the rules
84499,Lupe Fiasco,Imma just go   And then well figure it out from there
84500,Lupe Fiasco,They say form follows function
84501,Lupe Fiasco,And if you just function properly things will form themselves
84502,Lupe Fiasco,Yeah thats kind of what it is
84503,Lupe Fiasco,So on that note   Americas most
84504,Lupe Fiasco,First off gotta send shout outs to my niggas
84505,Lupe Fiasco,Then shout outs to my inner demon that be creepin around my temple
84506,Lupe Fiasco,Ready to set me off like Vivica or make me cross like a crucifix
84507,Lupe Fiasco,Or the legs on a Buddhist sitter deep in thought
84508,Lupe Fiasco,Thinking as deep as the sea of salt
84509,Lupe Fiasco,And they sink in the same sea that we walk
84510,Lupe Fiasco,Not that we Jesus we just dont wait until it thaws
84511,Lupe Fiasco,But you can hold my hand like applause pause
84512,Lupe Fiasco,With no homophobia involved
84513,Lupe Fiasco,Now if I wouldve said that you can hold my balls like VFW Halls
84514,Lupe Fiasco,That wouldve been the call but naw

84529,Lupe Fiasco,But thats only if you super dawg
84530,Lupe Fiasco,Sicker than when you use your dog to do assaults
84531,Lupe Fiasco,You can never really tell just whos the fraud
84532,Lupe Fiasco,Truth might still be alive like true and false
84533,Lupe Fiasco,Thats why I never really trust unless its Lu endorsed

85860,Lupe Fiasco,Aint nobody wins like the government
85861,Lupe Fiasco,Cause this is all for shares
85862,Lupe Fiasco,And you can fight it but theres no defense
85863,Lupe Fiasco,Cause the complexity is enormous
85864,Lupe Fiasco,Using one of my greatest losses with eyes like faucets
85865,Lupe Fiasco,To reinforce every single word that I talk with
85866,Lupe Fiasco,Something about losing things human beings
85867,Lupe Fiasco,That reduces things to their most elementary
85868,Lupe Fiasco,Find yourself where you never meant to be
85869,Lupe Fiasco,With the energy of memories
85870,Lupe Fiasco,Thats the soul force of whats behind killing me
85871,Lupe Fiasco,Finding pleasure in the pains
85872,Lupe Fiasco,Like finding desert in the rain
85873,Lupe Fiasco,Twisted how this world can drive you masochistic
85874,Lupe Fiasco,Or if Im numb because Im closureless
85875,Lupe Fiasco,Or my closures that we all gotta go and shit
85876,Lupe Fiasco,Rendered emotionless but moving at the speed of running over it
85877,Lupe Fiasco,Still happy that I opened it

85881,Lupe Fiasco,Floating right there in the air
85882,Lupe Fiasco,Nodding his head to the music I slightly lose it
85883,Lupe Fiasco,Ask why do I put myself through this
85884,Lupe Fiasco,Crack a smile look up at the file
85885,Lupe Fiasco,The waveforms on the screen of me tryna tell you what I mean
85886,Lupe Fiasco,But I feel that its all lost or maybe that its all gotta cross
85887,Lupe Fiasco,Happy with his dedicated song
85888,Lupe Fiasco,But he was never there cause
85889,Lupe Fiasco,He was everywhere nowhere and down here
