17576,Childish Gambino,This is on a bus back from camp
17577,Childish Gambino,I m thirteen and so are you
17578,Childish Gambino,Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
17579,Childish Gambino,I hadn t met yet running around all summer getting into trouble
17580,Childish Gambino,It turned out it would be me and just one girl That s you
17581,Childish Gambino,And we re still at camp as long as we re on the bus
17582,Childish Gambino,And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
17583,Childish Gambino,We re still wearing our orange camp t shirts We still smell like pineneedles
17584,Childish Gambino,I like you and you like me and I more than like you
17585,Childish Gambino,But I don t know if you do or don t more than like me
17586,Childish Gambino,You ve never said so I haven t been saying anything all summer
17587,Childish Gambino,Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
17588,Childish Gambino,And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
17589,Childish Gambino,A girl who s smart and funny and who if I say something dumb for a laugh
17590,Childish Gambino,Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
17591,Childish Gambino,But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
17592,Childish Gambino,A girl who reads books that no one s assigned to her
17593,Childish Gambino,Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
17594,Childish Gambino,From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
17595,Childish Gambino,Back in the real world we don t go to the same school
17596,Childish Gambino,And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
17597,Childish Gambino,We won t go to the same high school
17598,Childish Gambino,So this is kind of it for us Unless I say something
17599,Childish Gambino,And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
17600,Childish Gambino,The sun s gone down and the bus is quiet A lot of kids are asleep
17601,Childish Gambino,We re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
17602,Childish Gambino,That looks like a kid we know
17603,Childish Gambino,And then I m like  Can I tell you something  
17604,Childish Gambino,And all of a sudden I m telling you
17605,Childish Gambino,And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
17606,Childish Gambino,And your face is there and gone and there and gone
17607,Childish Gambino,As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
17608,Childish Gambino,And there s no expression on it
17609,Childish Gambino,And I think just after a point I m just talking to lengthen the time
17610,Childish Gambino,Where we live in a world where you haven t said  yes or  no yet
17611,Childish Gambino,And regrettably I end up using the word  destiny 
17612,Childish Gambino,I don t remember in what context Doesn t really matter
17613,Childish Gambino,Before long I m out of stuff to say and you smile and say  okay 
17614,Childish Gambino,I don t know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive
17615,Childish Gambino,And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
17616,Childish Gambino,But there s nowhere to go because we re on a bus
17617,Childish Gambino,So I pretend like I m asleep and before long I really am
17618,Childish Gambino,I wake up the bus isn t moving anymore
17619,Childish Gambino,The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
17620,Childish Gambino,I turn and you re not there
17621,Childish Gambino,Then again a lot of kids aren t in their seats anymore
17622,Childish Gambino,We re parked at the pick up point which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
17623,Childish Gambino,The bus is half empty You might be in your dad s car by now
17624,Childish Gambino,Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
17625,Childish Gambino,The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
17626,Childish Gambino,Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
17627,Childish Gambino,Just as one of them reaches my row
17628,Childish Gambino,It used to be our row on our way off
17629,Childish Gambino,It s Michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
17630,Childish Gambino,After throwing rocks at my head
17631,Childish Gambino,Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body wise
17632,Childish Gambino,She stops and looks down at me
17633,Childish Gambino,And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so I can t really see her face
17634,Childish Gambino,But I can see her smile And she says one word  destiny 
17635,Childish Gambino,Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
17636,Childish Gambino,And then she turns and leads them off the bus
17637,Childish Gambino,I didn t know you were friends with them
17638,Childish Gambino,I find my dad in the parking lot He drives me back to our house and camp is over
17639,Childish Gambino,So is summer even though there s two weeks until school starts
17640,Childish Gambino,This isn t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
17641,Childish Gambino,This is a story about how I learned something and I m not saying this thing is true or not
17642,Childish Gambino,I m just saying it s what I learned
17643,Childish Gambino,I told you something It was just for you and you told everybody
17644,Childish Gambino,So I learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always
17645,Childish Gambino,Everybody can t turn around and tell everybody everybody already knows I told them
17646,Childish Gambino,But this means there isn t a place in my life for you or someone like you
17647,Childish Gambino,Is it sad Sure But it s a sadness I chose
17648,Childish Gambino,I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
17649,Childish Gambino,And got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit
17650,Childish Gambino,But that s not true The truth is I got on the bus a boy And I never got off the bus
17651,Childish Gambino,Man made the Web you dont need a name
17652,Childish Gambino,Man made of faults I aint too ashamed
17653,Childish Gambino,Every thought I had put it in a box  box

23515,CunninLynguists,Start training this game is hard
23516,CunninLynguists,And arduous youre gonna play in the dark like when it rains in the park
23517,CunninLynguists,Youre hardly conscious of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic
23518,CunninLynguists,To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
23519,CunninLynguists,Now youre working yourself out the same as when you strain with a nautilus
23520,CunninLynguists,And youre willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
23521,CunninLynguists,If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
23522,CunninLynguists,Then do you really regret when youve shredded your promises 
23523,CunninLynguists,Now Ive tested the waters kid Sipped it rippled the pond a bit
23524,CunninLynguists,Visits have been abolished and this shits killing my confidence
23525,CunninLynguists,Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment 
23526,CunninLynguists,If you miss chicks when theyre around the phrase  Lets quit isnt an option
23527,CunninLynguists,You best fix whatevers wrong and just move on and get on with it
23528,CunninLynguists,Cause Youll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
23529,CunninLynguists,Its sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch
23530,CunninLynguists,When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
23531,CunninLynguists,Cause It isnt really my time is it Shit I just found the watch
23532,CunninLynguists,But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock
23533,CunninLynguists,And I cant die without trying my hands tied in knots
23534,CunninLynguists,Knowing that Ill never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
23535,CunninLynguists,Love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of
23536,CunninLynguists,Death  its as massive a shock
23537,CunninLynguists,And to intellects its a fuckin smack in the crotch
23538,CunninLynguists,Its a cancer that rots your soul tosses demons off of the road
23539,CunninLynguists,Just use caution and know that love aint nothing but a loss of control
23540,CunninLynguists,Lovell have you nervous doing stupid shit on purpose
23541,CunninLynguists,Brain out of service words slurred when you blurt shit
23542,CunninLynguists,Studderin utterin non sensical shit in your verses
23543,CunninLynguists,Feeling like a shirtless four breasted woman in a circus
23544,CunninLynguists,Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
23545,CunninLynguists,Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
23546,CunninLynguists,So girls create a false world of filling on boys
23547,CunninLynguists,Exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
23548,CunninLynguists,But when you have it theres nothing like it you get excited
23549,CunninLynguists,Seeking those who provide it on phones talking to psychics
23550,CunninLynguists,Some fear it spend their entire lives trying to fight it
23551,CunninLynguists,Living in a confusing Hayes like theyre grooving to Isaac
23552,CunninLynguists,It aint the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
23553,CunninLynguists,It aint easily learnable with definitions in tact
23554,CunninLynguists,It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
23555,CunninLynguists,Hittin and bullwhippin you leavin them slits in your back
23556,CunninLynguists,But Ive been a lucky one loving parents loving friends
23557,CunninLynguists,But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
23558,CunninLynguists,But I aint a genius on it I can only pretend
23559,CunninLynguists,Cause over all its an emotion I cannot comprehend
23560,CunninLynguists,Love aint the basis for action
23561,CunninLynguists,In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
23562,CunninLynguists,Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
23563,CunninLynguists,Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
23564,CunninLynguists,And the past isnt felt as a match made in hell
23565,CunninLynguists,But rather its held as a latter day meld
23566,CunninLynguists,Of common mistakes and nice intentions
23567,CunninLynguists,But when false love retention is simply vice invention
23568,CunninLynguists,Its only right to mention the fights you get in
23569,CunninLynguists,Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
23570,CunninLynguists,So whats love really got to do with it 
23571,CunninLynguists,From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
23572,CunninLynguists,The truth isnt as eloquent so be intelligent
23573,CunninLynguists,Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of its irrelevant
23574,CunninLynguists,And that wordll fit like a glove if you dont get right
23575,CunninLynguists,Now live your life for the love or stop
23576,CunninLynguists, So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin 
23577,CunninLynguists, Yeah Why dont you rap for food then  
23578,CunninLynguists,Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef

23999,CunninLynguists,Burned bridges occurred from scriptin my words
24000,CunninLynguists,Word so Ill chisel a verse
24001,CunninLynguists,On these lie filled halls that Ive lived in and searched
24002,CunninLynguists,Im still lost in a head of catacombs

24004,CunninLynguists,Ive killed off every damsel that I know
24005,CunninLynguists,For castles that I keep castles that I know
24006,CunninLynguists,Im having spirits in the dark laying under moonlight
24007,CunninLynguists,Laughing with a stranger like I saved her from her doomed life
24008,CunninLynguists,Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
24009,CunninLynguists,Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
24010,CunninLynguists,A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
24011,CunninLynguists,Life is like a lion and Im dying at its feet
24012,CunninLynguists,I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
24013,CunninLynguists,Ive seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B roll
24014,CunninLynguists,My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
24015,CunninLynguists,And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
24016,CunninLynguists,My memory banks the only thing I tend to rob
24017,CunninLynguists,And every time I phone the lob Im out of dodge
24018,CunninLynguists,Its hard on the boulevard and other clich s
24019,CunninLynguists,The type of bullshit that Im feeding self these days
24020,CunninLynguists,Corrosion on my relays one thing my mirrors chose

24029,CunninLynguists,Then off into my extremities and out into the public
24030,CunninLynguists,In a flood of shadow puppetry something in the air
24031,CunninLynguists,Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self aware
24032,CunninLynguists,Its recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
24033,CunninLynguists,Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
24034,CunninLynguists,Close encounters exacerbate his condition

24087,CunninLynguists,Let haters be theme music playin in the background
24088,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24089,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24090,CunninLynguists,There was a time when I couldnt find energy
24091,CunninLynguists,The only person that was feelin me was Mrs Hennessy
24092,CunninLynguists,Its like life was pinnin me down
24093,CunninLynguists,I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
24094,CunninLynguists,You aint gonna be a rapper youre not a factor
24095,CunninLynguists,You just a Kentucky boy get yourself a tractor
24096,CunninLynguists,Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
24097,CunninLynguists,Thats when the liquor and weed became a need
24098,CunninLynguists,Self esteem was lower than snorkel cities
24099,CunninLynguists,Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel s titties
24100,CunninLynguists,Then as soon as I started getting some pride
24101,CunninLynguists,My sister hydroplaned and died on I   
24102,CunninLynguists,In a family full of pride house full of tears
24103,CunninLynguists,Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
24104,CunninLynguists,Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
24105,CunninLynguists,Till the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear
24106,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24107,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24108,CunninLynguists,I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
24109,CunninLynguists,And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
24110,CunninLynguists,Cant grow fond of past memories
24111,CunninLynguists,Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
24112,CunninLynguists,Offended by the mental imagery
24113,CunninLynguists,And suggest livin in poverty was really meant for me
24114,CunninLynguists,Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
24115,CunninLynguists,Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
24116,CunninLynguists,I cant begin to see how to control the flash backs
24117,CunninLynguists,Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
24118,CunninLynguists,Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
24119,CunninLynguists,When I dont perceive what I feel I deserve
24120,CunninLynguists,Being slurred by those not livin in my position
24121,CunninLynguists,My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
24122,CunninLynguists,And when I thought Id risen life freezes the frame
24123,CunninLynguists,So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain
24124,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24125,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24126,CunninLynguists,I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
24127,CunninLynguists,Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
24128,CunninLynguists,You know what blasphemys like cursing at God
24129,CunninLynguists,Cause you aint got shit it hurts and its hard
24130,CunninLynguists,Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
24131,CunninLynguists,Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
24132,CunninLynguists,Most of my lifes a daze got me forever lighting haze
24133,CunninLynguists,Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
24134,CunninLynguists,For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
24135,CunninLynguists,Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
24136,CunninLynguists,Few friends even then most homies is fake
24137,CunninLynguists,Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
24138,CunninLynguists,I went from the block with my fam to college exams
24139,CunninLynguists,But the pressures still there dog Im still scared
24140,CunninLynguists,But I know it will all be right in the end
24141,CunninLynguists,As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen
24142,CunninLynguists, I shine in spaces where time is just a glare 
24143,CunninLynguists,  hold the mic like a memory 
24144,CunninLynguists,Its four o clock on a Sunday morning
24145,CunninLynguists,Who the hell is calling my phone

24149,CunninLynguists,I m in jail I need bail Again the word is bond

24279,CunninLynguists,Stuck in your ways cause hatred is hard to forget
24280,CunninLynguists,Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
24281,CunninLynguists,Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
24282,CunninLynguists,And even though nobodys life is ever perfect
24283,CunninLynguists,You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
24284,CunninLynguists,Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
24285,CunninLynguists,Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
24286,CunninLynguists,People who pimp children are really raping religion
24287,CunninLynguists,The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
24288,CunninLynguists,But now the technology follows me solemnly
24289,CunninLynguists,Building the future laws to my philosophy
24290,CunninLynguists,Alzheimers cutting through like a lobotomy
24291,CunninLynguists,Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
24292,CunninLynguists,Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
24293,CunninLynguists,I survived disease and political crisis
24294,CunninLynguists,By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
24295,CunninLynguists,And now I live vicariously through my kids
24296,CunninLynguists,Like people who love the sport but cant play for shit
24297,CunninLynguists,Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
24298,CunninLynguists,I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
24299,CunninLynguists,Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
24300,CunninLynguists,But just before I vanish as I think Im at the end
24301,CunninLynguists,The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again
24302,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24303,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24304,CunninLynguists,Old fashioned people they never know why
24305,CunninLynguists,The world is changing day to day
24306,CunninLynguists,It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
24307,CunninLynguists,Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
24308,CunninLynguists,Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
24309,CunninLynguists,I feel weathered but feel like Ive been driving forever
24310,CunninLynguists,Showin up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
24311,CunninLynguists,Ive been better but all things pass
24312,CunninLynguists,This life is taking everything away but youre provided with your past
24313,CunninLynguists,So fuck it  I stick to having dreams on the road
24314,CunninLynguists,But until this dream is done Im gonna keep my eyes closed
24315,CunninLynguists,And breathe breathe when it snows
24316,CunninLynguists,Breathe when Im forced to live a life with a person on a phone
24317,CunninLynguists,Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin
24318,CunninLynguists,Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
24319,CunninLynguists,Cause after the show when the last star shines
24320,CunninLynguists,I can make this all better when I close my eyes
24321,CunninLynguists,Im in another zone where troubles gone
24322,CunninLynguists,Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
24323,CunninLynguists,A place where life is easy for everybody else
24324,CunninLynguists,I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
24325,CunninLynguists,But we dont know it where we dont show it all
24326,CunninLynguists,For life aint protocol under sky over law
24327,CunninLynguists,Im in another space where all the food is good
24328,CunninLynguists,And theres enough for everybody in my neighborhood
24329,CunninLynguists,Where all the grass is blue where we dont know bout green
24330,CunninLynguists,Cause money aint a thing I pinch myself its not a dream
24331,CunninLynguists,Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
24332,CunninLynguists,If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldnt mean a thing
24333,CunninLynguists,Between climbing and finding it not worth it
24334,CunninLynguists,Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
24335,CunninLynguists,Im so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
24336,CunninLynguists,I think of home when I close my eyes
24337,CunninLynguists,So done with the smokes and fries
24338,CunninLynguists,Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
24339,CunninLynguists,Drinks I shouldnt drink things I never write
24340,CunninLynguists,Cities I never liked now its like aight
24341,CunninLynguists,Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
24342,CunninLynguists,Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
24343,CunninLynguists,My work is love no complaints Im fine
24344,CunninLynguists,Its been a long night cant wait to close my eyes
24345,CunninLynguists,I dream of an industry ego less
24346,CunninLynguists,And free from the modern chains with these chains were so deep in love
24347,CunninLynguists,Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
24348,CunninLynguists,Dreaming a publicist wasnt  Gs a month
24349,CunninLynguists,And where its not about numbers and math
24350,CunninLynguists,And I was content with really just a couple of fans
24351,CunninLynguists,And my happiness wasnt relying on tours and a van
24352,CunninLynguists,Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
24353,CunninLynguists,With the front front row stadium packed
24354,CunninLynguists,And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
24355,CunninLynguists,And scream at them  Look at me now look at me man 
24356,CunninLynguists,Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
24357,CunninLynguists,Kept running and gunning gunning success in my path
24358,CunninLynguists,Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
24359,CunninLynguists,I woke up and realized it was a dream
24360,CunninLynguists,Wide awake in the rap game but life Im asleep
24361,CunninLynguists,You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
24362,CunninLynguists,I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
24363,CunninLynguists,Part of my shine comes from the distance
24364,CunninLynguists,You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
24365,CunninLynguists,Is this business emotionally invested 
24366,CunninLynguists,Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
24367,CunninLynguists,Love is war sex is a weapon
24368,CunninLynguists,The mind is a mine so watch where youre steppin
24369,CunninLynguists,Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
24370,CunninLynguists,Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
24371,CunninLynguists,Feelings are just filling in this half baked scene
24372,CunninLynguists,To make x rated into nc   
24373,CunninLynguists,Then see everything she got she not shy
24374,CunninLynguists,Our love below so dro we most high
24375,CunninLynguists,Then wears off when what we wears on
24376,CunninLynguists,Again I turn away when what we shares gone
24377,CunninLynguists,If this is not the hardest part
24378,CunninLynguists,If passion dies within routine
24379,CunninLynguists,Lovin aint easy when you running scared

24913,CunninLynguists,And even if the world does end I cant be mad at God
24914,CunninLynguists,Cause life coulda been much worse At least Im satisfied

24917,CunninLynguists,At least I have life Some people their life was stolen

24921,CunninLynguists,It hurts the soul and leaves a scar on your conscience
24922,CunninLynguists,But its a blessing that I made it through this nonsense
24923,CunninLynguists,So even if this will be my last night
24924,CunninLynguists,At least when its over Ill be doin alright

24931,CunninLynguists,Cluthing my brain my sense of security changed
24932,CunninLynguists,Usually confidence was pure in me now fear in my veins
24933,CunninLynguists,Said  any of this shit could brang nuclear weapons
24934,CunninLynguists,   any of this shit could end at any second

24942,CunninLynguists,Not alot of wealth but alot of peace within my self
24943,CunninLynguists,Not a whole lot of forgotten pieces upon the shelf
24944,CunninLynguists,Disclipline from loving parents though they raised me
24945,CunninLynguists,When I was young I was wild
24946,CunninLynguists, christ hope he could stand it
24947,CunninLynguists,Now I do right  wherever I can manage
24948,CunninLynguists,The devil was eating me alive but I climbed out of that sandwich
24949,CunninLynguists,Now possibly on the verge of having everything vanish
24950,CunninLynguists,Feeling as if I didnt do anything as I planned it
24951,CunninLynguists,Like I was trying to live my life right but somebody panned it
24952,CunninLynguists,But I still had love when down helping hands lifted
24953,CunninLynguists,Me up outta the mud outta the muck
24954,CunninLynguists,And outta the dark and attitude when I didnt give a fuck
24955,CunninLynguists,From them days in the park alone drinking gin by the cup
24956,CunninLynguists,Through an exitless maze wandering and constantly stuck
24957,CunninLynguists,The blessings were always there I just chose to ignore them
24958,CunninLynguists,Shit started getting sweeter when I learned to explore them
24959,CunninLynguists,Wasnt selfish with them trying to stretch and contort them
24960,CunninLynguists,And didnt let the world get to them first and distort them
24961,CunninLynguists,So as I  kick back and ponder on armeggedon
24962,CunninLynguists,And I   spit raps about where my life couldve been headin
24963,CunninLynguists,I  admit that  I do have a wonderful life
24964,CunninLynguists,So if this night was my last ill be doin alright

24970,CunninLynguists,When I went to Jack in Tennessee to erase memory
24971,CunninLynguists,When I called on Mary J be my serenity
24972,CunninLynguists,So I dont see that all my enemies resembled me
24973,CunninLynguists,Im feeling faceless heading for a bitter state
24974,CunninLynguists,Im trying to place but my heart aint even in the race
24975,CunninLynguists,Ive came far enough that turning back is time wasted
24976,CunninLynguists,Imprisoned by fear I dont need no iron bracelets
24977,CunninLynguists,Whats my fate how can I escape my heart
24978,CunninLynguists,Running blind an open mind could break this dark
24979,CunninLynguists,A major spark might just make a star in this

24987,CunninLynguists,Thrust from my groin that could populate an Ark
24988,CunninLynguists,Thoughts in my mind only popular in dark
24989,CunninLynguists,I can t let come to light so I might suffocate the spark
24990,CunninLynguists,That might just spark the fuse that blows my views of self apart
24991,CunninLynguists,Opinions of my health my self and wealth go off the chart
24992,CunninLynguists,My struggle to keep balance ain t a challenge it s an art
24993,CunninLynguists,Outside my sleep is silent  cause inside the war is fought

25839,CunninLynguists,Some chain smoke with no link or hope
25840,CunninLynguists,You are the living truth of life ooh ooh
25841,CunninLynguists,The fastest can t run from who they are
25842,CunninLynguists,I d run from self but no man can run that far
25843,CunninLynguists,Turn the page eventually I hit a certain age
25844,CunninLynguists,Learn that all the freedom was worthless when you re afraid
25845,CunninLynguists,Success can often be a perfect cage
25846,CunninLynguists,Searching for a way to stay the same while the world will change
25847,CunninLynguists,A prisoner trapped in the regret
25848,CunninLynguists,Cuz the ego can t keep up if they happen to reject it
25849,CunninLynguists,Sometimes you want so bad to be respected
25850,CunninLynguists,Goin after it  til you ve left your happiness neglected
25851,CunninLynguists,I ve seen the weakness in grown men
25852,CunninLynguists,Playing games with their pain they cheat but they don t win
25853,CunninLynguists,Seen  em feed the needle deep into their own skin
25854,CunninLynguists,Tryna find a fleeting bit of peace in that moment
25855,CunninLynguists,More success to fix what s left
25856,CunninLynguists,Take an even bigger risk like after this I ll rest
25857,CunninLynguists,Til he painted with the razor on his wrist a red
25858,CunninLynguists,The color of lips pucker up it s the kiss of death
25859,CunninLynguists,I m Bustin Loose no Wilder just a Pryor  prior 
25860,CunninLynguists,And that debt was paid in spades and barbed wire
25861,CunninLynguists,Later use eyes to weigh and move fire
25862,CunninLynguists,Then moved crowds in wades with hellfire
25863,CunninLynguists,Meet a fan kick it witcha take a picture
25864,CunninLynguists,Sign both titties and give a pound to your mister
25865,CunninLynguists,Realer than steel I da grabbed before I picked up a pen and a pad
25866,CunninLynguists,Chiller than the look in the eye of a junkie when he s looking to buy looking to fly
25867,CunninLynguists,Pyrex on the good eye of a broke stove
25868,CunninLynguists,Pyramid of cans tin foil with poke holes
25869,CunninLynguists,Soft white girl break your nose and gets harder
25870,CunninLynguists,Revenge of the Caine  the original Get Carter
25871,CunninLynguists,Take your favorite star make him into a martyr
25872,CunninLynguists,Life ain t Trending it s ending
25873,CunninLynguists,Whatll you do if there comes a day when I lose my way 
25874,CunninLynguists,Oh I would stand by you  Word  
25875,CunninLynguists,If it would help I d even die for you
25876,CunninLynguists,I spent too many nights drowned in seclusion
25877,CunninLynguists,Over against my own will surrounded by illusions
25878,CunninLynguists,Fighting to stay positive however losing
25879,CunninLynguists,Cause my personality was founded on the conclusion that
25880,CunninLynguists,The human heart does more than just pump blood
25881,CunninLynguists,It pumps love at least I know that mine did once
25882,CunninLynguists,But a large piece of it was undone
25883,CunninLynguists,And washed away by painful rains but when the sun comes
25884,CunninLynguists,Scars heal and we learn from our mistakes
25885,CunninLynguists,Some people sometimes their purpose is to hate
25886,CunninLynguists,But be certain of your faith and you ll acquire the ability
25887,CunninLynguists,To expose witches and burn them at the stake
25888,CunninLynguists,I m looking for love I m done searching for a date
25889,CunninLynguists,Ive been alone for years but it s worth it if you wait
25890,CunninLynguists,Personally late s better than never at all
25891,CunninLynguists,So when I brush myself off whenever I fall tell me
25892,CunninLynguists,Oh yeah That s what the last one said
25893,CunninLynguists,Unfortunately I was mad misled
25894,CunninLynguists,I ran on E til no more gas was left
25895,CunninLynguists,The most I got from her was ass and bread
25896,CunninLynguists,But trust was lost like Kanye s fashion sense
25897,CunninLynguists,Accidents happen when you live with the weak
25898,CunninLynguists,But it s not an accident when you make a conscious decision to cheat
25899,CunninLynguists,That s enough reason to get into beef
25900,CunninLynguists,Throw all your spouse s shit on the street quit  retreat
25901,CunninLynguists,But these are the breaks as told by Kurtis Blow
25902,CunninLynguists,So please for my sake stay by me this earth is cold
25903,CunninLynguists,And I m freezing like I ve been lying in dirt and snow
25904,CunninLynguists,I ve searched the globe for a person who knows
25905,CunninLynguists,The true meaning of love you could be the one
25906,CunninLynguists,If you mean what you say we could link up
25907,CunninLynguists,And use what we learned from our exes in the past
25908,CunninLynguists,But wait cause I got another question to ask and that s 
25909,CunninLynguists,Sounds good and if you mean it I ll hook up with you this evening
25910,CunninLynguists,Hug your body squeezing your love while I feed it
25911,CunninLynguists,The touch of a king when you re my queen
25912,CunninLynguists,And trust is the the key in every relationship
25913,CunninLynguists,But other human beings who see in may try to rush up for no reason
25914,CunninLynguists,But looks can be deceiving
25915,CunninLynguists,Like books you never read and only judge by the cover art
25916,CunninLynguists,So don t let it crush your heart when they try to use jealousy to pull our love apart
25917,CunninLynguists,That s when the thunder starts followed by the rain
25918,CunninLynguists,But the first line of this song already explained
25919,CunninLynguists,That my arteries were drained now all of me is tame
25920,CunninLynguists,So stay beside me cause I don t wanna be estranged
25921,CunninLynguists,As soon as time found them they were saved
25922,CunninLynguists,And still lay there to this day
25923,CunninLynguists,But if this should ever change
25924,CunninLynguists,Just stay and I mma do the same
25925,CunninLynguists,The darkness of the night has gone
25926,CunninLynguists,Crystal drops of morning dew are gone
25927,CunninLynguists,Crystal drops of morning dew are gone
25928,CunninLynguists,They trying to kick us out the hood niggas want us  gone 
25929,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone 
25930,CunninLynguists,Crack a Corona just zone while Im sipping on it

25936,CunninLynguists,Folks who can change it all  gone 
25937,CunninLynguists,Leaving new jacks with nooses to swing with
25938,CunninLynguists,The Carter got a dog park smoothies and sandals
25939,CunninLynguists,Thanks to the pimps pushers hustlers and vandals
25940,CunninLynguists,And heroes they slander hit them with scandals
25941,CunninLynguists,Or literally kill them let the world light candles they  gone 
25942,CunninLynguists,And they aint coming back black
25943,CunninLynguists,Unless its on a street sign shirt or a snapback
25944,CunninLynguists,Underfunded school headstone or a back tat
25945,CunninLynguists,Located in a trap that snap when the rat snack is  gone 
25946,CunninLynguists,No brown on the streets where baristas rule
25947,CunninLynguists,And two fingers is the only hard peace to pull
25948,CunninLynguists,For the tenants thats in it
25949,CunninLynguists,But for hostages of the hard knocks commuted the sentence
25950,CunninLynguists,To a brand new prison they can sit til the bars are all  gone 
25951,CunninLynguists,They trying to get us out the hood them people want us  gone 
25952,CunninLynguists,So stressed smoking good til the marijuanas  gone 
25953,CunninLynguists,Crack a Corona just zone while Im sipping on it

25960,CunninLynguists,Now the village full of hellions
25961,CunninLynguists,And the people want rebellion
25962,CunninLynguists,But their Innocence is  gone 
25963,CunninLynguists,And what are we to teach them 
25964,CunninLynguists,When all the grannies are beneath them
25965,CunninLynguists,And the families are divided
25966,CunninLynguists,Searching but I ve been told the silver lining is  gone 
25967,CunninLynguists,This is when fear talks ears off
25968,CunninLynguists,Many corporations calculate what a tear cost
25969,CunninLynguists,Morals break down like they biodegradable
25970,CunninLynguists,Too keep the faith or give it up
25971,CunninLynguists,Are the lights that shine in the darkest times  Gone 
25972,CunninLynguists,I m hoping this as bad as it gets
25973,CunninLynguists,They trying to kick us out the hood niggas want us  gone

26273,CunninLynguists,Become infected with feelings so Im electing this evil
26274,CunninLynguists,To end my life without reason cause Im indicted for treason
26275,CunninLynguists,Closin my eyes and Im leakin draggin the knife till Im bleedin
26276,CunninLynguists,Cause its the life that Im seekin feels only right that Im meetin
26277,CunninLynguists,With Jesus seeking redemption but he dont want my repentance
26278,CunninLynguists,For he who feels my intention sees that my deepest impression
26279,CunninLynguists,Is feeding me to these demons that lurk and feed on my essence
26280,CunninLynguists,The pain is deep in my chest and I keep repeatin my blessings
26281,CunninLynguists,Ever since a meek adolescence that saw me beaten by freshmen
26282,CunninLynguists,Parents repeatedly sentenced heroin needles on dressers
26283,CunninLynguists,They use to feed their infection I cant repeat indescretions
26284,CunninLynguists,So I pause for reflection long for honest affection
26285,CunninLynguists,And getting lost in the music is only soothing for stretches
26286,CunninLynguists,If you knew where my head is when Im doing these records
26287,CunninLynguists,Youd never listen to my music again I cant let you

26294,CunninLynguists,The agreement turned cement
26295,CunninLynguists,Hip Hop the vinyl frontier
26296,CunninLynguists,Two turntables a mic and a cold stereo DJ one MC the imperial
26297,CunninLynguists,Many many put their muse to it
26298,CunninLynguists,Sent bop sent rock sent blues through it
26299,CunninLynguists,From classical to jazz we can who s who it
26300,CunninLynguists,Or blow the dust off and groove to it
26301,CunninLynguists,You know that crackle give the best high
26302,CunninLynguists,Give me a needle a cartridge a partridge some tree   s and a    let it be
26303,CunninLynguists,A new format hit the scene like way back
26304,CunninLynguists,It was smaller and more convenient than   track
26305,CunninLynguists,You could pop it in your car on a long drive
26306,CunninLynguists,Play the album or fast forward to song five
26307,CunninLynguists,If you passed the song you had to rewind it back
26308,CunninLynguists,It was kind of frustrating trying to find a track
26309,CunninLynguists,Where the Biz was on the radio with BDK
26310,CunninLynguists,When they was on the air I was on the pause button
26311,CunninLynguists,I had the best taste but I aint trying to cause nothing
26312,CunninLynguists,Cause everybody thought their paws was the raws
26313,CunninLynguists,Cats used to battle this shit used to cause wars
26314,CunninLynguists,We would trade tapes that was the best it could be
26315,CunninLynguists,Busy Bee had the fever for Treacherous Three
26316,CunninLynguists,Having the best tapes was like a status symbol
26317,CunninLynguists,The yellow tape purple tape to the baddest demo
26318,CunninLynguists,Battles travel from the Bronx to Baltimore
26319,CunninLynguists,They would stand by the speaker to record them all
26320,CunninLynguists,Them same tapes that was labeled with a thick marker
26321,CunninLynguists,Made the neighbourhood rappers want to spit sharper
26322,CunninLynguists,If my tape pop trust I was ready man
26323,CunninLynguists,A razor blade scotch tape and a steady hand
26324,CunninLynguists,My cassette went under the knife and brought back to life
26325,CunninLynguists,My relationship with bass and kicks had come full circle
26326,CunninLynguists,Plastic and cheap but I clapped to the beat
26327,CunninLynguists,Stab the repeat button and keep running
26328,CunninLynguists,And thats something you cant get from tape dubbing
26329,CunninLynguists,Skip the skips with a flick of the wrist
26330,CunninLynguists,More time to check whats sick on the list
26331,CunninLynguists,The fickle dismissed this little digital disk
26332,CunninLynguists,But try and play vinyl in the whip itll skip
26333,CunninLynguists,And its    Im trying to get laid now
26334,CunninLynguists,Chose the format with binary laid down
26335,CunninLynguists, s and  s and  s and  s flood the BOSE with flows and drums

26342,CunninLynguists,Everywhere but non existant what a conundrum
26343,CunninLynguists,Upgraded but they say we forgot where we come from
26344,CunninLynguists,The past feels even further with every second
26345,CunninLynguists,Off the record the coming and going of Kbps
26346,CunninLynguists,In the day of the instant message
26347,CunninLynguists,The message is misdirected and the receiver seems to be disconnected
26348,CunninLynguists,But dont complain love game
26349,CunninLynguists,Even after the flood came and left our neighbors over saturated
26350,CunninLynguists,With no computer love just computer bugs

26458,CunninLynguists,And a night cap slapped on to keep my head cool
26459,CunninLynguists,Awaken in a state of confusion
26460,CunninLynguists,Dressing quickly to get back to my city
26461,CunninLynguists,I ve seen all the things that pass me by
26462,CunninLynguists,I cling to my dreams as I grab the sky

26527,CunninLynguists,If youve experienced everything except a purpose
26528,CunninLynguists,Then youve missed everything that was meant to be caught
26529,CunninLynguists,Life sessions arent lessons that can be simply taught
26530,CunninLynguists,You gotta strengthen self or your shield will shatter
26531,CunninLynguists,In the field we choose to scatter like lice
26532,CunninLynguists,Instead of coming together and keeping it tight
26533,CunninLynguists,Its hard to be alone deep in the night
26534,CunninLynguists,I try to avoid the dark life and be seeking the light
26535,CunninLynguists,But so many times I fall in between the lines
26536,CunninLynguists,Of what is a devilish sign and what is divine
26537,CunninLynguists,If you base your life on wasted nights with no faith in sight
26538,CunninLynguists,You might as well freebase on pipes

26547,CunninLynguists,If you hold yourself tight you cant lose it
26548,CunninLynguists,Life or death its up to you who you cruise with

26550,CunninLynguists,If you know yourself youll be shown your wealth  x  
26551,CunninLynguists,Sometimes I ask myself a question
26552,CunninLynguists,Is my lack of inner reflection
26553,CunninLynguists,Some type of indication of what state my life is in 
26554,CunninLynguists,They keep piping in elevator music
26555,CunninLynguists,Sappy and happy as hell with foo foo shit
26556,CunninLynguists,When I reflect back and recollect that
26557,CunninLynguists,I was born into the state of walking slumber
26558,CunninLynguists,Taught numbers realize Im dirt poor
26559,CunninLynguists,It hurts more now that Im older
26560,CunninLynguists,Showered in water much colder than this

26563,CunninLynguists,Talk about an identity crisis
26564,CunninLynguists,My third eye remains sightless
26565,CunninLynguists,Contemplate fights with vice grips
26566,CunninLynguists,Depressions and lessons in starvation
26567,CunninLynguists,Sittin perfectly still listen to your own heart racin
26568,CunninLynguists,Assume the description of my life and its reality
26569,CunninLynguists,Is on the warm side of fatality
26570,CunninLynguists,Its not fair the way you challenge me
26571,CunninLynguists,Or the silent way my talents be
26572,CunninLynguists,Hidden inside these translations
26573,CunninLynguists,Emancipation as I try to dab the slate clean
26574,CunninLynguists,Futile attempts to make my fate glean
26575,CunninLynguists,It makes me want to fall reclusive
26576,CunninLynguists,And rip the tallest loose leaf

79893,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79894,Logic,I remember somehow someway
79895,Logic,It was December of     in sunny Los Angeles California in the heart of Hollywood
79896,Logic,I stood next to my wife in a line surrounded by hundreds of other people on our way to watch Star Wars
79897,Logic,When suddenly I was engulfed with fear and panic
79898,Logic,In this moment my mind was full of clarity
79899,Logic,But my body insisted it was in danger
79900,Logic,I looked around and I told myself I was safe I was fine
79901,Logic,But I was convinced that something was wrong
79902,Logic,Before I knew it I felt as though I was going to
79903,Logic,And soon enough I found myself in a hospital bed being told what I went through was anxiety
79904,Logic,I refused to believe this story
79905,Logic,I searched and searched for the cause of what had happened to me
79906,Logic,I began to feel detached from reality
79907,Logic,I felt as though I was seeing the world through a glass
79908,Logic,Analysis of my mind and body to no avail
79909,Logic,The doctor said it was anxiety
79910,Logic,But how could it be anxiety 
79911,Logic,How could anxiety make me physically feel off balance 
79912,Logic,How could anxiety make me feel as though I was fading from this world and on the brink of death 
79913,Logic,The sense of being out of one s body
79914,Logic,Nothing but this feeling of panic
79915,Logic,Nobody knows the sufferings
79916,Logic,Can it in fact be the mind controlling the body 
79917,Logic,I m so in control of my mind and my body
79918,Logic,But I m subconsciously forcing myself into a state
79919,Logic,Of self bondage entangled by the ropes of my own mind
79920,Logic,I am scared I am human I am a man
79921,Logic,But I look in the mirror and I see a child
79922,Logic,I am an adult who recognize grown ups don t really know shit
79923,Logic,Cause now I m just a grown up who doesn t know shit
79924,Logic,But one thing is I do know this feeling this horrible feeling is going to kill me
79925,Logic,Just like you the person I wrote this for
79926,Logic,And together we will overcome this feeling
79927,Logic,We will remember despite the attacks and constant feeling of our mind and body being on the edge
79928,Logic,And any moments we have free of this feeling we will not take for granted
79929,Logic,We will rejoice in this gift that is life
79930,Logic,We will rejoice in this day that we have been given
79931,Logic,We will accept our anxiety and strive for the betterment of ourselves
79932,Logic,Starting with mental health
79933,Logic,We will accept ourselves as we are
79934,Logic,And we will be happy with the person we see in the mirror

80829,Logic,You ll be doing things you don t like doing in order to go on living that is to go on doing things you don t like doing which is stupid It is absolutely stupid Better to have a short life that is full of what you like doing than a long life spent in a miserable way And after all if you do really like what you re doing it doesn t matter what it is somebody is interested in everything anything you can be interested in you will find others who are   
80830,Logic,But it s absolutely stupid to spend your time doing things you don t like and to teach our children to follow in the same track See what we are doing is we re bringing up children and educating them to live the same sort of lives we are living in order that they may justify themselves and find satisfaction in life by bringing up their children to bring up  their children to do the same thing So it s all retch and no vomit it never gets there Therefore it s so important to consider this question

81942,Logic,Cause in my mind the only way I fail if my verse weak
81943,Logic,As I look in the crowd and see thousands of different faces
81944,Logic,Compiled of different races gathering from different places
81945,Logic,I just contemplate shout out to those who can relate
81946,Logic,And even though it gets hard I know my fate
