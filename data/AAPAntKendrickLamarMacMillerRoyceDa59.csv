70459,Kendrick Lamar,This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine

70462,Kendrick Lamar,I know exactly what happened
70463,Kendrick Lamar,You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
70464,Kendrick Lamar,Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
70465,Kendrick Lamar,Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up

70510,Kendrick Lamar,Back to where they used to be then Ill probably be in the denim
70511,Kendrick Lamar,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
70512,Kendrick Lamar,Or better yet a leader you need her to learn somethin
70513,Kendrick Lamar,Then you probably need to beat her thats how I was taught
70514,Kendrick Lamar,Three niggas in one room first time I was tossed
70515,Kendrick Lamar,And Im exhausted but fuck that  Sorry for your loss shit

70519,Kendrick Lamar,And if you have a album date just make sure Im not in the song
70520,Kendrick Lamar,Cause I dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own
70521,Kendrick Lamar,And matter fact did I mention that I physically feel great 
70522,Kendrick Lamar,A doctors approval is a waste of time I know Im straight
70523,Kendrick Lamar,Ill probably live longer than you and never fade away
70524,Kendrick Lamar,Ill never fade away Ill never fade away I know my fate
70525,Kendrick Lamar,And Im on the grind for this cake Ima get it or die tryin

70537,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70538,Kendrick Lamar,Promise that you will sing about me
70539,Kendrick Lamar,Sometimes I look in the mirror
70540,Kendrick Lamar,And ask myself Am I really scared of passin away 
70541,Kendrick Lamar,If its today I hope I hear a
70542,Kendrick Lamar,Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
70543,Kendrick Lamar,With the Holy Ghost til it drown in the blood of Jesus
70544,Kendrick Lamar,I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin
70545,Kendrick Lamar,The scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance
70546,Kendrick Lamar,With the other side may come soon and if Im doomed
70547,Kendrick Lamar,May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
70548,Kendrick Lamar,And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
70549,Kendrick Lamar,And Im not sure why Im infatuated with death
70550,Kendrick Lamar,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
70551,Kendrick Lamar,That can come about  cause the tongue is mighty powerful
70552,Kendrick Lamar,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch

71143,Kendrick Lamar,Found myself screaming in the hotel room
71144,Kendrick Lamar,I didn t wanna self destruct
71145,Kendrick Lamar,The evils of Lucy was all around me
71146,Kendrick Lamar,So I went running for answers
71147,Kendrick Lamar,But that didn t stop survivor s guilt
71148,Kendrick Lamar,Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
71149,Kendrick Lamar,Or maybe how A  my foundation was
71150,Kendrick Lamar,But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city
71151,Kendrick Lamar,A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
71152,Kendrick Lamar,Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
71153,Kendrick Lamar,Just because you wore a different gang color than mines
71154,Kendrick Lamar,Doesn t mean I can t respect you as a black man
71155,Kendrick Lamar,Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
71156,Kendrick Lamar,If I respect you we unify and stop the enemy from killing us

71246,Kendrick Lamar,Describing my world it says 
71247,Kendrick Lamar, The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
71248,Kendrick Lamar,Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it
71249,Kendrick Lamar,In order to protect itself from this mad city
71250,Kendrick Lamar,While consuming its environment
71251,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
71252,Kendrick Lamar,One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him
71253,Kendrick Lamar,The butterfly represents the talent the thoughtfulness
71254,Kendrick Lamar,And the beauty within the caterpillar
71255,Kendrick Lamar,But having a harsh outlook on life
71256,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak
71257,Kendrick Lamar,And figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
71258,Kendrick Lamar,Already surrounded by this mad city
71259,Kendrick Lamar,The caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon
71260,Kendrick Lamar,Which institutionalizes him
71261,Kendrick Lamar,He can no longer see past his own thoughts
71262,Kendrick Lamar,When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root such as
71263,Kendrick Lamar,Going home and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
71264,Kendrick Lamar,Wings begin to emerge breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
71265,Kendrick Lamar,Finally free the butterfly sheds light on situations
71266,Kendrick Lamar,That the caterpillar never considered ending the internal struggle
71267,Kendrick Lamar,Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different
71268,Kendrick Lamar,They are one and the same

105345,Royce Da 59,Now sometime around   I found my calling
105346,Royce Da 59,And that all coincides with the time that I found my darling
105347,Royce Da 59,Now later on in the story I tell you her significance
105348,Royce Da 59,But now lets talk about me specifically three brothers and one sister see
105349,Royce Da 59,My daddy taught me consistency with his fucking patterns
105350,Royce Da 59,Hallelujah Im the son of a addict
105351,Royce Da 59,My addiction was music all I would do is go to the studio and The Shelter

105363,Royce Da 59,Was right across from the first studio I ever recorded at
105364,Royce Da 59,Now I would have to assume that it was either meant for me to be rapping
105365,Royce Da 59,Or meant for me to be laughing at Gods geographical humor
105366,Royce Da 59,As soon as I stepped foot in the open mic it was like a reunion
105367,Royce Da 59,I met Kino there too and he asked me to manage me
105368,Royce Da 59,And that was back in like let me see
105369,Royce Da 59,   my girl was pregnant hurdles was prevalent
105370,Royce Da 59,And it was therapeutic just for me to breathe into my mic
105371,Royce Da 59,Started learning why the Lord put certain people in my life
105372,Royce Da 59,And the way he started blessing me uh
105373,Royce Da 59,I guess before my inner demons got the best of me like sneezing was my vice

105388,Royce Da 59,Im trying to figure out why the Lord chose us
105389,Royce Da 59,Or maybe chose me to ride in this emotional rollercoaster
105390,Royce Da 59,My momma said  The baby here yet  I said  Maybe 
105391,Royce Da 59,She said  Maybe Baby go see 
105392,Royce Da 59,I walk away feeling like a good father the same time as a terrible son

105394,Royce Da 59,She got to get to bout nine til its that time
105395,Royce Da 59,And meanwhile Im more popular in this hospital than the doctors
105396,Royce Da 59,Nurses watching whispering like  Thats the one right there
105397,Royce Da 59,Who got a lady in labor on  and another lady dying on   
105398,Royce Da 59,By this time I dont even fuckin remember that I got a show

105407,Royce Da 59,Hopeless tryna find me hopin in time Godll guide me
105408,Royce Da 59,In the future just as I was about to leave out

105426,Royce Da 59,For me to lose such a beautiful soul in my granny
105427,Royce Da 59,And gain such a beautiful soul with my first born son little Royce
